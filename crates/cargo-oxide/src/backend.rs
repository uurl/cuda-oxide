//! Backend discovery and building.
//!
//! Finds or builds `librustc_codegen_cuda.so` using this priority:
//!
//! 1. `CUDA_OXIDE_BACKEND` env var (explicit override)
//! 2. Project config (`.cargo/cuda-oxide.toml`)
//! 3. Local repo (detected by presence of `crates/rustc-codegen-cuda`)
//! 4. Cached `.so` at `~/.cargo/cuda-oxide/librustc_codegen_cuda.so`, but
//!    only when it was built from the commit the project's cuda-oxide
//!    dependency resolves to (see "The backend follows the dependency" below)
//!    and none of the staleness checks fire
//! 5. Build from the dependency's checkout and cache the result. A project
//!    with no cuda-oxide dependency falls back to cloning `main` (one-time,
//!    or after a stale-cache miss)
//!
//! ## Cache staleness (issue #49)
//!
//! `cargo install` always rewrites `~/.cargo/bin/cargo-oxide` on every
//! upgrade, bumping its mtime. The cached `.so` is only ever written by
//! step 5 below, so a binary newer than the cache is the canonical signal
//! that the user has just upgraded `cargo-oxide` and the cached backend
//! no longer matches the binary loading it. When step 4 detects that, we
//! drop both the cached `.so` *and* the cached source tree so that step 5
//! re-clones fresh and rebuilds, rather than rebuilding from a clone that
//! was taken whenever the user first installed.
//!
//! ## Cache staleness vs. source (backend source advances)
//!
//! The binary-mtime check above does not fire when the developer updates
//! the backend SOURCE (the `rustc-codegen-cuda` crate) but leaves the
//! `cargo-oxide` binary unchanged. In that case the cached `.so` is older
//! than the source it was built from, yet the binary check sees no upgrade
//! and the stale backend is silently reused. To catch this we also compare
//! the cached `.so` against the newest mtime of the backend source inputs
//! (the crate's `src/**` and `Cargo.toml`) found in the cached source tree.
//! When the source tree cannot be located we degrade gracefully to the
//! binary-only check rather than erroring.
//!
//! The two stale signals call for different recovery. A binary upgrade means
//! the cached source may no longer match the new binary, so we drop the
//! source tree and re-clone fresh (above). A source advance means the cached
//! source IS the newer truth, so we rebuild the `.so` from that existing
//! source in place; re-cloning would throw away the very source that
//! triggered the rebuild. Binary staleness takes precedence when both fire.
//!
//! ## Cache staleness vs. toolchain (the active rustc changes)
//!
//! The mtime checks above miss a toolchain swap: the cached `.so` is
//! dynamically linked against one specific `librustc_driver-<hash>.so`, but a
//! repo `rust-toolchain.toml` or a changed default nightly leaves the
//! `cargo-oxide` binary and the cached source untouched. The stale `.so` then
//! loads against the wrong driver and fails with a cryptic
//! `librustc_driver-<hash>.so: cannot open shared object file`. To catch this
//! we record the fingerprint (`rustc -vV`) of the toolchain that built the
//! `.so` (resolved from the backend source directory, exactly like the build
//! command itself) next to the cached `.so`, and compare it on every lookup
//! against the toolchain active in the user's cwd; a recorded fingerprint
//! that differs from the active toolchain forces a fresh re-clone and rebuild.
//! This check has the highest precedence, since a toolchain mismatch makes the
//! cached `.so` unloadable regardless of mtimes. A cache predating the
//! fingerprint file defers to the mtime checks (a `cargo-oxide` reinstall or
//! `rm -rf ~/.cargo/cuda-oxide` heals those).
//!
//! Re-cloning can only heal a mismatch when upstream's pin agrees with the
//! user's (e.g. upstream main moved to the nightly the user just pinned).
//! When the user's project and the backend source genuinely pin DIFFERENT
//! nightlies, every rebuild re-records the same mismatching fingerprint and a
//! naive retry loops on a multi-minute cold rebuild per invocation. To stop
//! that, each heal attempt first records the (active, recorded) fingerprint
//! pair in a marker file next to the cached `.so`; if the very same pair
//! mismatches again after a rebuild, the lookup reports both toolchain
//! identities with guidance and exits instead of rebuilding. Any lookup that
//! passes the fingerprint check deletes the marker, so a genuinely healed
//! cache clears the memory.
//!
//! ## The backend follows the dependency
//!
//! Outside the repository, the backend source is the checkout Cargo made for
//! the project's `cuda-device` / `cuda-host` dependency (see
//! [`crate::backend_source`]), so the crates a kernel compiles against and
//! the backend that lowers it always come from one commit. That commit is
//! recorded next to the cached `.so` (`source-rev.txt`) and compared on every
//! lookup; a project resolving a different commit rebuilds the cache from its
//! own checkout. A path dependency is a local checkout and builds in place,
//! the same way step 3 does. Dependency checkouts build into
//! `~/.cargo/cuda-oxide/target`, one tree cargo-oxide owns (delete it to
//! reclaim the space) that consecutive commits share their dependency builds
//! in, rather than into Cargo's checkout.
//!
//! Under `cargo oxide` the rustup proxy exports `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` for the
//! project's toolchain, and every child `cargo`/`rustc`, the backend build
//! included, uses it; a checkout's own `rust-toolchain.toml` gets no say.
//! That file still states the nightly the commit was written for, and
//! rustc_private APIs change between nightlies, so before any build the
//! project's active toolchain is compared with that channel and a mismatch is
//! reported up front, naming the channel to set, instead of spending minutes
//! on a backend that fails to compile or to load. The toolchain heal marker
//! above guards only the `main` clone path: a rebuild from a pinned
//! dependency's checkout converges by construction.

//! cargo-oxide: Cargo subcommand for building and running cuda-oxide programs.
//!
//! Replaces the xtask pattern with a proper cargo subcommand that works both
//! inside the cuda-oxide repo (for developers) and externally (for users).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo oxide run vecadd              # build + run an example
//! cargo oxide run debug -- --fail-assert  # forward args to the example binary
//! cargo oxide build vecadd            # build only
//! cargo oxide pipeline vecadd         # verbose pipeline dump
//! cargo oxide sanitize vecadd         # run under NVIDIA Compute Sanitizer
//! cargo oxide debug vecadd --tui      # build + cuda-gdb
//! cargo oxide inspect vecadd          # build + print generated PTX
//! cargo oxide fuzz-schedule barrier   # perturb generated PTX and watchdog it
//! cargo oxide new my_kernel           # scaffold a standalone project
//! cargo oxide new my_kernel --async   # scaffold with async template
//! cargo oxide list                    # list bundled examples
//! cargo oxide list --json             # machine-readable output
//! cargo oxide fmt                     # format all crates
//! cargo oxide doctor                  # check environment
//! cargo oxide clean                   # remove local build outputs
//! cargo oxide setup                   # explicitly build/install backend
//! cargo oxide update                  # refresh cached backend (external)
//! ```

//! Grid-scoped intrinsics: barriers and queries that span the entire kernel launch.
//!
//! The grid is the top-level CUDA execution scope: every block in every cluster
//! belongs to it. Most kernels never need a grid handle — block-level work is
//! independent. The two cases where this module matters are:
//!
//! - **Iterative algorithms** (rehash, multi-pass solvers, BFS frontiers) that
//!   need every block to finish phase `k` before any block starts phase `k+1`.
//! - **Cooperative reductions** that produce one final value visible to every
//!   thread in the launch.
//!
//! # The cooperative launch contract
//!
//! [`sync`] is **only valid in cooperative kernel launches**. The host must
//! use `#[cooperative_launch]` on a `#[cuda_module]` kernel, call
//! `cuda_core::launch_kernel_cooperative`, or use
//! `unsafe { cuda_launch! { cooperative: true, ... } }`; a normal launch deadlocks
//! because not every block is guaranteed to be co-resident on the GPU and
//! the driver does not populate the per-launch grid workspace pointer.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! [`sync`] is the byte-for-byte equivalent of NVCC's
//! `cooperative_groups::grid_group::sync()` lowering — there is no external
//! dependency on `libcudadevrt.a`:
//!
//! 1. Block-wide `bar.sync 0` so every thread in the block is at the barrier.
//! 2. Block leader (`tid == 0`) reads the per-launch grid workspace pointer
//!    out of PTX environment registers `%envreg1` (high 32 bits) and
//!    `%envreg2` (low 32 bits). The CUDA driver writes the pointer there
//!    automatically for cooperative launches. (Convention matches the
//!    public CUDA driver-ABI header.)
//! 3. Block leader does an atomic add (release semantics, gpu scope) on the
//!    workspace's barrier counter. The "GPU master" block (`blockIdx == 0`)
//!    contributes a value crafted so that the counter's high bit flips
//!    exactly when every block has arrived; every other block contributes 1.
//! 4. Block leader spin-loads the counter with acquire semantics until the
//!    counter's high bit has flipped relative to its arrival value.
//! 5. Final block-wide `bar.sync 0` releases every thread.
//!
//! The phase-flip approach is self-resetting: the counter's high bit toggles
//! on every successful sync, so consecutive `grid::sync()` calls within a
//! single launch (or back-to-back launches that share the workspace) work
//! without any host intervention.

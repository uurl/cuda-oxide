//! Shared memory support for CUDA kernels.
//!
//! Shared memory is a fast, block-scoped memory space that all threads
//! in a block can access. Use it for:
//! - Tile-based algorithms (GEMM, convolutions)
//! - Reductions and scans
//! - Inter-thread communication within a block
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Declare shared memory as `static mut` inside a kernel:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use cuda_device::{kernel, thread, SharedArray};
//!
//! #[kernel]
//! pub fn tiled_kernel(data: &[f32], mut out: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
//!     static mut TILE: SharedArray<f32, 256> = SharedArray::UNINIT;
//!
//!     let tid = thread::threadIdx_x() as usize;
//!
//!     unsafe {
//!         // Each thread loads one element
//!         TILE[tid] = data[global_idx];
//!     }
//!
//!     thread::sync_threads();
//!
//!     unsafe {
//!         // Now safe to read what other threads wrote
//!         let neighbor = TILE[(tid + 1) % 256];
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! All shared memory access requires `unsafe` because:
//! - Memory is **uninitialized** at kernel start
//! - Multiple threads access concurrently (potential races)
//!
//! Use `thread::sync_threads()` to ensure all writes are visible before reading.
//!
//! # Block Scope
//!
//! - All threads in a block see the **same** shared memory
//! - Different blocks have **independent** copies
//! - Memory does not persist between kernel launches
//!

/// Block-scoped shared memory array.
///
/// Declare as `static mut` inside a kernel function. The cuda-oxide compiler
/// recognizes this type and allocates memory in GPU shared memory space
/// (LLVM address space 3).
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// static mut TILE: SharedArray<f32, 256> = SharedArray::UNINIT;
///
/// unsafe {
///     TILE[tid] = value;
/// }
/// thread::sync_threads();
/// unsafe {
///     let v = TILE[other_tid];
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `T`: Element type (f32, f64, i32, etc.)
/// - `N`: Array size (must be known at compile time)
/// - `ALIGN`: Alignment in bytes (0 = natural alignment, 128 for TMA destinations)
///
/// # Alignment
///
/// By default (`ALIGN = 0`), shared memory uses natural alignment based on the
/// element type. For TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator) destinations, use `ALIGN = 128`
/// to meet the 128-byte alignment requirement:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // Regular shared memory - natural alignment
/// static mut TILE: SharedArray<f32, 256> = SharedArray::UNINIT;
///
/// // TMA destination - 128-byte alignment required
/// static mut TMA_TILE: SharedArray<f32, 256, 128> = SharedArray::UNINIT;
/// ```
///
/// # Soundness: `!Sync`
///
/// `SharedArray` is intentionally `!Sync`. GPU shared memory is concurrently
/// accessed by all threads in a block, and correctness depends on hardware
/// barriers (`sync_threads` / `bar.sync`) that are invisible to Rust's type
/// system. If the type were `Sync`, it would promise that `&SharedArray` can
/// be safely shared across threads — but concurrent reads after concurrent
/// writes are only safe *after* a barrier, which the compiler cannot verify.
///
/// This is achieved via `PhantomData<UnsafeCell<...>>` (`UnsafeCell` is `!Sync`).
/// The type remains `Send` when `T: Send`.
///
/// All access is through `static mut` (which independently requires `unsafe`),
/// so this primarily guards against future abstractions that might incorrectly
/// rely on a `Sync` bound.

// DynamicSharedArray - Runtime-sized shared memory
// ============================================================================

/// Dynamic (runtime-sized) shared memory with configurable alignment.
///
/// Unlike [`SharedArray`] which has a compile-time known size, `DynamicSharedArray`
/// allows the shared memory size to be specified at kernel launch time via
/// `LaunchConfig::shared_mem_bytes`.
///
/// This enables CUTLASS-style patterns where the same kernel PTX can be used
/// with different shared memory configurations.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `T`: Element type for the returned pointer
/// - `ALIGN`: Base alignment in bytes (default: 16, matching nvcc)
///
/// # Alignment
///
/// The `ALIGN` parameter controls the alignment of the `extern __shared__`
/// declaration in PTX:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // Default alignment (16 bytes, matches nvcc for char[])
/// let smem: *mut f32 = DynamicSharedArray::<f32>::get();
/// // PTX: .extern .shared .align 16 .b8 __dynamic_smem[];
///
/// // TMA-compatible alignment (128 bytes required for TMA operations)
/// let tma_smem: *mut f32 = DynamicSharedArray::<f32, 128>::get();
/// // PTX: .extern .shared .align 128 .b8 __dynamic_smem[];
///
/// // Higher alignment for specific cache patterns
/// let aligned_smem: *mut f32 = DynamicSharedArray::<f32, 256>::get();
/// // PTX: .extern .shared .align 256 .b8 __dynamic_smem[];
/// ```
///
/// Common alignment values:
/// - `16` (default): Matches nvcc, suitable for most use cases
/// - `128`: Required for TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator) operations
/// - `256`: Cache-line friendly for some architectures
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use cuda_device::{kernel, DynamicSharedArray, DisjointSlice};
///
/// #[kernel]
/// pub fn flexible_kernel(data: &[f32], mut out: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
///     // Get typed pointer to dynamic shared memory
///     let smem: *mut f32 = DynamicSharedArray::<f32>::get();
///
///     // Or partition the memory for multiple arrays
///     let smem_a: *mut f32 = DynamicSharedArray::<f32>::get();
///     let smem_b: *mut f32 = DynamicSharedArray::<f32>::offset(1024); // After 1024 bytes
///
///     // Access elements (unsafe - no bounds checking)
///     unsafe {
///         *smem_a.add(thread::threadIdx_x() as usize) = 1.0;
///     }
/// }
///
/// // For TMA operations, use 128-byte alignment:
/// #[kernel]
/// pub fn tma_kernel(tensor_map: *const TmaDescriptor, mut out: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
///     let tma_buffer: *mut u8 = DynamicSharedArray::<u8, 128>::get_raw();

/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Host-side Launch
///
/// Specify the shared memory size in the launch configuration:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // SAFETY: argument list matches `flexible_kernel`'s signature.

///     cuda_launch! {

///         config: LaunchConfig {
///             grid_dim: (blocks, 1, 1),

///         },
///         // ...
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Memory Partitioning
///
/// All calls to `DynamicSharedArray::get()` and `DynamicSharedArray::offset()` within

///
/// ```rust,ignore

///
/// // Second array: 256 f32s starting at offset 1024
/// let array_b: *mut f32 = DynamicSharedArray::<f32>::offset(1024);
///
/// // Launch with: shared_mem_bytes = 2048

///
/// # Safety
///

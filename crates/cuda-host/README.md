# cuda-host

Host-side infrastructure for typed CUDA module loading and kernel launches in
cuda-oxide.

The primary interface is `#[cuda_module]`. Place kernels in an inline module,
keep `#[kernel]` on the actual GPU entry points, then load the embedded device
artifact as a typed Rust value.

```rust
use cuda_core::simt::LaunchConfig;
use cuda_core::{CudaContext, DeviceBuffer};
use cuda_device::{DisjointSlice, kernel, thread};
use cuda_host::cuda_module;

#[cuda_module]
mod kernels {
    use super::*;

    #[kernel]
    pub fn vecadd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], mut c: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
        let idx = thread::index_1d();
        if let Some(c_elem) = c.get_mut(idx) {
            *c_elem = a[idx.get()] + b[idx.get()];
        }
    }
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let ctx = CudaContext::new(0)?;
    let stream = ctx.default_stream();

    const N: usize = 1024;
    let a_dev = DeviceBuffer::from_host(&stream, &vec![1.0f32; N])?;
    let b_dev = DeviceBuffer::from_host(&stream, &vec![2.0f32; N])?;
    let mut c_dev = DeviceBuffer::<f32>::zeroed(&stream, N)?;

    let module = kernels::load(&ctx)?;
    // SAFETY: this raw configuration is one-dimensional and matches vecadd's
    // index calculation. Prefer a launch contract when geometry is known.
    unsafe {
        module.vecadd(
            &stream,
            LaunchConfig::for_num_elems(N as u32),
            &a_dev,
            &b_dev,
            &mut c_dev,
        )?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

## Generated API

`#[cuda_module]` adds these items to the annotated module:

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LoadedModule` | Typed handle around the embedded CUDA module and cached kernel functions |
| `load(&Arc<CudaContext>)` | Load the current package's embedded bundle; unsafe when the module has a launch contract |
| `load_named(&Arc<CudaContext>, name)` | Load a specific embedded bundle by name; unsafe when the module has a launch contract |
| `from_module(Arc<CudaModule>)` | Wrap an already-loaded CUDA module; unsafe when the module has a launch contract |
| `LoadedModule::{kernel}` | Safe prepared launch for a contracted kernel; unsafe raw launch otherwise |
| `load_async(device_id)` | With feature `async`, load from a `cuda-async` device context; unsafe when contracted |
| `LoadedModule::{kernel}_async` | With feature `async`, build a lazy prepared launch; unsafe when given raw configuration |
| `LoadedModule::{kernel}_async_owned` | Build an owned async launch that returns its buffers; unsafe when given raw configuration |

Kernel parameters are mapped into host launch parameters:

| Kernel parameter | Host method parameter |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| `&[T]` | `&DeviceBuffer<T>` |
| `&mut [T]` | `&mut DeviceBuffer<T>` |
| `DisjointSlice<T>` | `&mut DeviceBuffer<T>` |
| `Uniform<T>` | `T` |
| `Copy` scalar, struct, closure, or raw pointer | unchanged |

A `Uniform<T>` parameter takes the bare scalar on the host because the host is
what makes the value uniform: one marshalled value reaches every thread of the
launch. The device side receives the witness, which is what device APIs needing
a launch-uniform scalar require in place of an `unsafe` assertion.

A slice whose index space carries a runtime row width takes `RowWidth<T>`, which
binds the width to that slice for the launch. The same reasoning applies and for
the same reason, one step earlier: the row width reaches the device as one word the
host wrote, so `DisjointSlice::tile_2d32_rt` needs neither a stride argument nor
an `unsafe` assertion. The owned async launches take `RowWidthOwned<B>`.

Because the launches are ordinary methods, rust-analyzer and rustc can complete
kernel names, show argument names, and type-check arguments before the program
runs. By-value arguments are copied into the CUDA launch packet through the
`KernelScalar` boundary; device slices are encoded as pointer-plus-length pairs.

`LaunchConfig` is safe to create because it is only data. Launching with one is
unsafe because its dimensions and resource values are not tied to the kernel:

```text
raw LaunchConfig   -> unsafe launch
PreparedLaunch<K>  -> safe launch of exactly K
```

For example, a 1-D index calculation silently repeats indices when launched
with a 2-D grid. An unsafe raw launch makes the caller acknowledge that proof;
the prepared path below checks it for safe code.

## Prepared Launch Contracts

`#[launch_contract]` is an opt-in path for kernels whose geometry and resource
assumptions are part of correctness, not merely a tuning choice:

```rust
#[kernel]
#[launch_bounds(256)]
#[launch_contract(
    domain = 1,
    block = (256, 1, 1),
    dynamic_shared = 1024,
    dynamic_shared_alignment = 128,
    min_compute_capability = (9, 0),
)]
fn reduce(input: &[f32], mut output: DisjointSlice<f32>) { /* ... */ }
```

Preparation resolves the exact generic kernel entry and checks the live CUDA
device and function once:

```text
LaunchConfig1D
      │ check block/grid limits, shared memory, CC, cluster/cooperative rules
      ▼
PreparedLaunch<reduce<T>>
      │ immutable function + configuration + context
      └──────────────> repeated launches make no capability/resource queries
```

```rust
let prepared = module.prepare_reduce(LaunchConfig1D::new(blocks, 256, 1024))?;
module.reduce(&stream, &prepared, &input, &mut output)?;
```

`LaunchConfig1D`, `LaunchConfig2D`, and `LaunchConfig3D` have private fields;
a 2-D configuration cannot be passed to a 1-D contract. The prepared value is
also branded with the exact kernel specialization, so `reduce::<f32>` and
`reduce::<f64>` are not interchangeable. Generic closures can use the generated
`prepare_{kernel}_for(&closure, config)` helper to infer their anonymous type.
If `#[launch_bounds]` uses a policy constant, each specialization has its own
host-side maximum. For example, `prepare_transform::<SmallPolicy>` can enforce
64 threads while `prepare_transform::<WidePolicy>` enforces 256. This is a
maximum, not an exact size; declare `block = (x, y, z)` when the full shape must
match.

An exact `block` is additionally carried into the compiled artifact as
`.reqntid x, y, z`, which the CUDA driver enforces per axis. Preparation and
the driver check the shape on independent paths, so a mismatch is rejected even
when preparation is bypassed. A thread maximum gives no such guarantee: under
`.maxntid 256, 1, 1` the driver accepts `(16, 16, 1)` as readily as
`(256, 1, 1)`.

For contracted kernels, raw `LaunchConfig` is available only through generated
unsafe methods such as `reduce_unchecked`. Uncontracted generated methods are
also unsafe because there is no prepared proof for their raw configuration.
Borrowed and owned prepared async methods return immutable wrappers, so safe
code cannot change geometry after validation; they recheck the
scheduler-selected stream's context at submission time.

Binding code is a one-time unsafe boundary for contracted modules. Embedded
bundles are currently named per package, not per library/binary target, so even
`load()` cannot prove that a same-package sibling contains the matching ABI and
contract. `load`, `load_async`, `from_module`, `load_named`, and
`load_async_named` therefore require the caller to assert artifact provenance.
For generic modules, the caller must also ensure the merged PTX bundles contain
the matching specializations and no conflicting entry definitions. Preparation
and repeated launches are safe after that binding.

The declared dynamic shared-memory byte range is an author contract because
arbitrary pointer offsets cannot be inferred. Alignment is compiler-enforced:
the marker emitted by `#[launch_contract]` is merged with alignment requests in
the body and reachable local helpers, and the stronger value reaches PTX.
Prelinked external helpers keep the alignment recorded when they were compiled.

Cluster and cooperative contracts may be declared together. Preparation proves
cluster geometry first (`cuOccupancyMaxActiveClusters`), then checks that the
full grid fits in that concurrent cluster capacity so a cooperative
`grid::sync()` cannot hang waiting for non-resident blocks. Oversized grids
fail with `LaunchContractError::CooperativeGridTooLarge`.

This closes the unsafe gap from issue #115. A 1-D contract rejects a 2-D launch
in safe code, while an uncontracted or deliberately mismatched launch requires
an explicit unsafe block:

```text
LaunchConfig1D -> prepare -> safe launch
raw dimensions ----------> unsafe launch
```

Enable the `async` feature to generate async launch methods. They use the same
scalar mapping, but take no stream argument:

```rust
use cuda_async::simt::device_operation::DeviceOperation;

let module = kernels::load_async(0)?;
let launch = unsafe {
    // SAFETY: this raw configuration matches vecadd's 1-D indexing.
    module.vecadd_async(
        LaunchConfig::for_num_elems(N as u32),
        &a_dev,
        &b_dev,
        &mut c_dev,
    )?
};
launch.sync()?;
```

For async launches, device-slice parameters accept either `DeviceBuffer<T>` or
`cuda_async::simt::device_box::DeviceBox<[T]>`. The mutable
`AsyncKernelLaunchBuilder` collects arguments and options. Finalizing it with a
raw configuration is unsafe and produces an immutable `AsyncKernelLaunch<'_>`;
geometry cannot be changed after that point. Rust keeps referenced buffers and
non-`'static` scalar arguments borrowed until the lazy operation is dropped,
`.sync()` has returned, or `.await` has completed.

Use `{kernel}_async_owned` when the operation needs to leave the current stack
frame, for example in a spawned Tokio task or a long-lived pipeline:

```rust
let launch = unsafe {
    // SAFETY: this raw configuration matches vecadd's 1-D indexing.
    module.vecadd_async_owned(
        LaunchConfig::for_num_elems(N as u32),
        a_dev,
        b_dev,
        c_dev,
    )?
};
let (a_dev, b_dev, c_dev) = launch.await?;
```

Owned async launch methods take device-slice arguments by value, keep them alive
for the GPU work, and return them as the operation output after completion.
Scalar arguments for owned async launches must be `'static`.

## Kernel Families

`KernelFamily` describes a small, fixed menu of ahead-of-time compiled entries.
It separates two questions that are easy to mix up:

```text
Eligibility: is this variant safe for the problem shape and hardware facts?
Preference:  which eligible variant should run here?
```

Each variant has an explicit stable ID, callable entry, and caller-defined
metadata. `SelectionMode::Force(id)` is a validated manual knob. Automatic
selection uses a cache when available and otherwise gives the selector only
eligible variants:

```text
Force(id) -> validate --------------------------------------> Override
Auto      -> validated cache hit ---------------------------> Cache
          -> selector([eligible variants]) -> cache store --> Selector
```

The family name and revision form the cache namespace. Bump the revision when
variants, their declaration order, eligibility, preference policy, or tuning
methodology changes. A reorder may keep the same revision only when selection
and tuning are explicitly order-independent.
Cached IDs are hints, not authority: unknown or newly ineligible values fall
back to the selector and are repaired. The core API does not query CUDA, time
kernels, start threads, or touch the filesystem; callers put the relevant facts
in their problem type.

The [gemm_sol_final example](../rustc-codegen-cuda/examples/gemm_sol_final/)
uses a two-entry family for its M256xN256 and M512xN256 output tiles. Its
automatic policy preserves the measured 4K/8K/16K choices, while
`GEMM_SOL_VARIANT` exposes either resource envelope as a checked override.

## Lower-Level Pieces

Generic kernels expose a `<kernel>_ptx_name::<...>()` helper when code needs to
inspect the concrete PTX entry name. `CudaKernel` and `GenericCudaKernel` are
the lower-level traits used by generated launch code. `cuda_launch!` remains
available as the unsafe low-level escape hatch for modules loaded at runtime by
name; it cannot check argument count or types against the kernel, so every use
must be wrapped in `unsafe { }`. For kernels embedded in your own crate, use
`#[cuda_module]` instead: it generates typed launch methods from the kernel
signatures.

`cuda_launch_async!` is also lower-level. It can describe lazy work from raw
device pointers, so callers must ensure the pointed-to allocations outlive the
operation. Generated borrowed async methods encode that requirement as Rust
borrows, and generated owned async methods move buffers into the operation for
spawned tasks.

`#[cuda_module]` loads the artifact produced by the compiler. PTX and cubin
payloads load directly. NVVM IR and LTOIR normally compile for the target
recorded with the artifact. A module built for a standard pre-Blackwell target,
such as `sm_86`, can also be converted to PTX and JIT-compiled by the CUDA
driver on Blackwell. This forward path is not available for suffixed targets,
such as `sm_90a`, and artifacts built for newer GPUs cannot run on older GPUs.
Because this path JIT-compiles PTX, the installed driver must support the PTX
version produced by the selected CUDA toolkit.

Pre-Blackwell targets use typed-pointer NVVM IR. Blackwell and newer targets
use opaque-pointer NVVM IR. The compiler records the selected target in the
embedded bundle and in the `<module>.target` file used by the lower-level
loader.

Older artifacts without a recorded target must be rebuilt or loaded with
`CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET` set to their original target.

File-backed NVVM IR and LTOIR cache native cubins below
`.oxide-artifacts/ltoir-cubin-cache/v1`. A cache entry is reused only when the
source, target, module names, ordered options, libdevice, and exact loaded
libNVVM/nvJitLink binaries all match. The cubin and optional LTOIR are verified
and published together, so a stopped or concurrent build cannot mix outputs.
If either CUDA library cannot be identified exactly, cuda-oxide rebuilds. PTX
selection and the pre-Blackwell to Blackwell PTX bridge do not use this cache.
The first compiler/linker handles are retained for the process lifetime;
restart the process to select another toolkit or after replacing one in place.
Remove the `.oxide-artifacts` directory to clear all cached entries.

The driver-independent `cuda-artifact-finalizer` crate owns the shared
libNVVM/nvJitLink policy. Runtime loading and build-time materialization
therefore use the same target, FMA, debug, input-order, provenance, and cubin
validation rules.

Deferred NVVM IR and LTOIR keep those policies in `<module>.options`. Existing
v1 sidecars record FMA contraction and imply no debug information; v2 sidecars
also record line-table or full-debug preservation. Missing sidecars on legacy,
unversioned artifacts retain the historical default of FMA enabled and no
debug information. In-memory callers can use the
`*_with_compile_options` helpers to carry the complete policy. The older
`*_with_options(..., allow_fma_contraction)` helpers remain available and use
no debug information.

//! Procedural macros for CUDA kernel development: `#[kernel]`, `#[device]`,
//! `#[cuda_module]`, `gpu_printf!`, `ptx_asm!`, and friends.
//!
//! # The `host` feature in mixed build graphs
//!
//! The default-on `host` cargo feature makes `#[kernel]` and `#[cuda_module]`
//! emit the generated host surface (the `LoadedModule` loader and launchers,
//! the `CudaKernel` marker impls), all of which names `::cuda_host` /
//! `::cuda_core`. A crate that only compiles kernels takes this crate with
//! `default-features = false` and drops the host dependency stack.
//!
//! Proc-macro features unify globally per build graph. If any crate in the
//! graph enables `cuda-macros/host`, every crate expanding these macros gets
//! the host-emitting expansion, including a device-only kernel crate; its
//! expansion then names `cuda_host`, which it cannot resolve (E0433). A
//! device-only kernel crate consumed by a host application must therefore
//! forward the feature itself:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [features]
//! host = ["dep:cuda-host", "cuda-macros/host"]
//! ```
//!
//! so the same switch that turns host emission on also adds the `cuda-host`
//! dependency that resolves it.

///   type and pass through `cuda_host::KernelScalar`
///
/// # Nested modules
///
/// Kernels may be organized in inline modules nested inside the annotated
/// module. Each namespace gets its own `LoadedModule` view, so launcher
/// signatures resolve types, private generated helpers, and raw module
/// identifiers beside the source kernel:
///
/// ```text
/// kernels::LoadedModule
///     -> kernels::stage::LoadedModule::from_parent(&kernels)
///         -> stage.step(...)
/// ```
///
/// All views share one loaded CUDA module and one generic-function cache.
/// Create deeper views from their immediate parent in the same way.
/// The name `LoadedModule` is therefore reserved in every inline namespace
/// that owns kernels or contains a deeper kernel namespace.
/// The generated method name `as_cuda_module` is reserved in every kernel
/// namespace, and `from_parent` is additionally reserved in nested namespaces.
///
/// Procedural macros cannot see the contents of `mod child;` or `include!`.
/// Those items are preserved, but kernels behind either boundary do not get
/// generated launchers. Keep auto-launched nested kernels in inline modules.
///
/// Launcher methods are namespace-qualified, but PTX entry symbols are still
/// bare function names. Kernel names must therefore be unique throughout one
/// `#[cuda_module]` tree, including cfg-gated alternatives; the macro rejects
/// duplicates rather than risk loading the wrong entry.
/// Raw module identifiers are supported. Raw kernel function identifiers are
/// not: their PTX-name contract predates nested-module support and remains an
/// unsupported edge for a future backend-wide naming change.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[cuda_module]
/// mod kernels {
///     use super::*;
///
///     #[kernel]
///     pub fn vecadd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], mut c: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
///         // ...
///     }
/// }
///
/// let module = kernels::load(&ctx)?;
/// // SAFETY: the raw launch is fully 1-D and matches vecadd's resources.
/// unsafe {
///     module.vecadd(&stream, LaunchConfig::for_num_elems(n), &a, &b, &mut c)?;
/// }
///
/// let module = kernels::load_async(0)?;
/// // SAFETY: the raw launch is fully 1-D and matches vecadd's resources.
/// unsafe {
///     module.vecadd_async(LaunchConfig::for_num_elems(n), &a, &b, &mut c)
/// }?.sync()?;
///
/// // SAFETY: the raw launch is fully 1-D and matches vecadd's resources.

/// ```
///
/// # Raw launch safety
///
/// A raw [`LaunchConfig`](https://docs.rs/cuda-core/latest/cuda_core/simt/launch/struct.LaunchConfig.html)
/// is not tied to the kernel's indexing model. The generated raw synchronous,
/// borrowed-async, and owned-async methods are therefore `unsafe`: callers must
/// prove that the chosen dimensions and resources satisfy the kernel. Add

/// ```
///
/// The flag composes with the other kernel arguments, e.g.
/// `#[kernel(f32, unchecked_indexing)]` or
/// `#[kernel(launch_context = lc, unchecked_indexing)]`.
///
/// The bare word `unchecked_indexing` is **reserved** in the `#[kernel]`
/// argument list: it always parses as this flag, never as a legacy
/// instantiation type. A user type literally named `unchecked_indexing` can
/// still be instantiated by spelling it as a path, e.g.
/// `#[kernel(self::unchecked_indexing)]` or
/// `#[kernel(crate::unchecked_indexing)]`, which parses as a type.
///
/// Scope and caveats:
///
/// - Only the checks behind indexing (`a[i]`) are removed. Arithmetic
///   overflow, division/remainder by zero, misaligned-pointer checks, and
///   every other safety check keep their normal compare-and-trap behavior.
/// - Range-indexing failures (`&a[i..j]`) and explicit panics arrive as calls
///   to `core::panicking::*`, not as MIR asserts, so they still trap.
/// - The flag covers the kernel's translated MIR body, including everything
///   rustc MIR-inlined into it. Separately translated `#[device]` functions
///   are **not** covered; the whole-build switch
///   `CUDA_OXIDE_UNCHECKED_INDEXING=1` (or `cargo oxide ...
///   --unchecked-indexing`) covers every translated body.
/// - Elision never leaks out of the opted kernel. For generic kernels
///   (including legacy `#[kernel(T, ...)]` instantiation), the expansion
///   keeps the elision marker on the generated entry function plus a hidden
///   unchecked twin of the implementation that only that entry calls. The
///   user-named implementation function stays ordinary bounds-checked Rust,
///   so a different kernel or `#[device]` function that calls it keeps its
///   own bounds checks (fail-closed).
///
/// # Loop unrolling
///
/// Put `#[unroll]` on a loop with a compile-time-known trip count to request full
/// unrolling. Use `#[unroll(N)]`, where `N >= 2`, to request `N` iterations of
/// work per trip; a remainder loop handles any leftovers.
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[kernel]
/// pub fn example(n: u32) {
///     let mut i = 0;
///     #[unroll]
///     while i < 4 { work(i); i += 1; }
///
///     let mut j = 0;
///     #[unroll(4)]
///     while j < n { work(j); j += 1; }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A factor may also be a typed `u32` policy constant, such as
/// `#[unroll(P::UNROLL)]`. A generic expression currently requires Rust's
/// `generic_const_exprs` feature. Partial factors must be in `2..=1024`; an
/// invalid specialization fails compilation instead of becoming a no-op.
///
/// The pass currently recognizes explicit counted `while` loops. Range-based
/// `for` loops are not yet recognized.
///
/// Only the annotated loop is unrolled. Inner loops are copied intact unless
/// they carry their own annotation. Several `continue` paths (multiple
/// back-edges) are supported.
///
/// Full `#[unroll]` preserves `break` paths and multiple exit targets. Partial
/// `#[unroll(N)]` currently requires the loop condition to be the only exit. If
/// the loop has a `break` or another extra exit, the compiler warns and skips
/// partial unrolling for that loop.
///
/// Partial unrolling also requires a positive counter step, a `<` or `<=` test,
/// and a limit that does not change inside the loop. One annotation may create
/// at most 1,024 body copies, 8,192 cloned basic blocks, and 65,536 cloned
/// operations. Factors above 1,024 are rejected; unsupported loop shapes warn

///
/// # Restrictions
///
/// - The static must be typed `ConstantMemory<T>`.
/// - The initializer must be `ConstantMemory::UNINIT` (or any other all-zeros

/// The grammar is deliberately tiny rather than arbitrary Rust, for two
/// reasons. Every identifier is validated against the kernel's actual
/// parameter list, so a typo is a compile error instead of a check against
/// the wrong value. And every `+`/`-`/`*` compiles to checked `u64`
/// arithmetic, so a huge `m * k` cannot wrap around to a small number and
/// falsely pass.
///
/// Every checked launcher generated by `#[cuda_module]` (the sync prepared
/// launcher and, with the `async` feature, the `_async` and `_async_owned`
/// twins) evaluates every relation once at launch time, before any argument
/// is handed to the driver. Evaluation widens every operand to `u64` and uses checked
/// arithmetic: a false relation fails with
/// `LaunchContractError::SizeRequirementViolated` (carrying the relation's source
/// text and both evaluated sides) and arithmetic leaving the `u64` range
/// fails with `LaunchContractError::SizeRequirementOverflow`, so a bad launch is
/// rejected on the CPU instead of trapping mid-kernel. The generated
/// `_unchecked` escape hatches intentionally skip these checks, exactly as
/// they skip the geometry checks; their safety contract passes the
/// obligation to the caller.
///
/// The relations are **enforced only by `#[cuda_module]`-generated
/// launchers**. On a kernel outside any `#[cuda_module]`, this attribute
/// still validates every relation for well-formedness at compile time
/// (unknown identifiers and unsupported grammar are errors at the attribute
/// site), but no launcher exists to evaluate the relations at runtime. That
/// is the same enforcement story as `dynamic_shared`.
///
/// An exact `block` is the one key that also holds without a generated
/// launcher. The shape reaches the device compiler as `.reqntid x, y, z`, and
/// the CUDA driver refuses any launch whose block differs on any axis, so a
/// standalone contracted kernel and an `_unchecked` raw launch are both
/// covered. `.reqntid` and `.maxntid` cannot appear on one entry, so a kernel
/// declaring an exact `block` emits `.reqntid` in place of the maximum that
/// `#[launch_bounds]` would otherwise contribute.

/// The macro injects `cuda_device::cluster::__cluster_config::<X, Y, Z>()` at the

/// 1. Detects this marker during MIR translation
/// 2. Extracts the const generic parameters (X, Y, Z)
/// 3. Emits `!nvvm.annotations` metadata with cluster dimensions

///

/// - each argument's **type, size, and alignment** match the corresponding
///   kernel parameter;
/// - every pointer argument is **device-accessible** (a valid device
///   allocation, or host memory reachable via HMM/unified memory) and stays
///   alive until the kernel finishes;
/// - the grid, block, dynamic-shared-memory size, cluster dimensions, and
///   cooperative mode satisfy every indexing, resource, and synchronization
///   assumption made by the kernel.
///
/// A mismatch is undefined behavior, not a runtime error: too few or
/// mistyped arguments make the driver read past the end of the args array,
/// and a bad pointer makes the device dereference junk.
///
/// For kernels embedded in your own crate, prefer `#[cuda_module]` with a
/// launch contract: it checks the signature and prepares a kernel-branded

# rustc-codegen-cuda

A custom rustc codegen backend that enables single-source CUDA programming in Rust. It intercepts rustc's code generation phase to split device code from host code -- device functions compile to PTX via the cuda-oxide pipeline, while host code passes through to the standard LLVM backend.

## Why Single-Source?

The alternative is split compilation: kernels live in a separate crate compiled with `#[cfg(cuda_device)]`, requiring two compilation passes, careful type coordination, and `instantiate!` macros for generics. With `rustc-codegen-cuda`, everything compiles in **one pass** -- host code and `#[kernel]` functions coexist in the same crate, share types naturally, and generics just work.

```rust
use cuda_device::{kernel, DisjointSlice};

#[kernel]
pub fn vecadd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], mut c: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
    if let Some((c_elem, idx)) = c.get_mut_indexed() {
        let i = idx.get();
        *c_elem = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Host code references the kernel directly.
    // PTX is generated alongside the host binary.
}
```

```

The backend implements rustc's `CodegenBackend` trait. When rustc calls `codegen_crate()`:

1. **Collect** -- `collector.rs` scans codegen units for functions prefixed with `cuda_oxide_kernel_<hash>_` (set by the `#[kernel]` proc-macro -- the prefix is owned by `crates/reserved-oxide-symbols/`, the workspace-internal source of truth for the cuda-oxide naming contract). It then walks the MIR call graph to gather all transitively reachable device functions.
2. **Compile device code** -- `device_codegen.rs` feeds the collected MIR through
   the cuda-oxide pipeline: translate to `dialect-mir`, run `mem2reg`, apply
   annotated unrolling, lower and export to LLVM IR, then compile PTX with `llc`.
3. **Compile host code** -- The standard `rustc_codegen_llvm` backend handles everything else.

## Usage

```bash
# Preferred: use the cargo-oxide wrapper
cargo oxide run vecadd

# Or build without running
cargo oxide build vecadd

# Manual: pass the backend as a rustc flag
RUSTFLAGS="-Z codegen-backend=/path/to/librustc_codegen_cuda.so" cargo run --release
```

### Required Compiler Flags

These are set automatically by `cargo oxide`. For manual invocations, all four are required:

| Flag                                    | Why                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `-C opt-level=3`                        | Enables MIR inlining and const-prop for device code |
| `-C debug-assertions=off`               | Strips debug checks from device code                |
| `-Z mir-enable-passes=-JumpThreading`   | Prevents barrier duplication across branches        |
| `-Z always-encode-mir`                  | Keeps dependency MIR available so the whole-program device collector can compile cross-crate functions that are neither `#[inline]` nor generic (e.g. recursive ones) |

> `panic=abort` is **not** required. The backend treats all unwind paths as unreachable since the CUDA toolchain does not support unwinding today (the hardware could; this is a compiler/runtime limitation).

### Environment Variables

| Variable                             | Effect                                      |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `CUDA_OXIDE_VERBOSE`                 | Verbose compilation output                  |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_PTX_DIR`                 | Output directory for PTX files              |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET`                  | GPU architecture override                   |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_LLC`                     | Path to a specific `llc`                    |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DUMP_MIR`                | Dump the `dialect-mir` module               |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DUMP_LLVM`               | Dump the LLVM dialect module                |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_SHOW_RUSTC_MIR`          | Dump raw rustc MIR                          |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_EMIT_NVVM_IR`            | Emit NVVM IR for libNVVM                    |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DEVICE_CODEGEN_CRATE`    | Comma-separated device owner crate filter   |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DEVICE_ARCH`             | Detected GPU arch; advisory (see below)     |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_DEBUG`                   | Device DWARF level override                 |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_NO_FMA`                  | Disable FMA contraction (presence only)     |
| `CUDA_OXIDE_NO_SPILL_WARN`           | Silence the register-spill warning          |

`CUDA_OXIDE_DEBUG` overrides the DWARF level rustc's `-C debuginfo` would
imply: `0`/`off`/`none`, `1`/`line`/`lines`/`line-tables`/`line-tables-only`,
or `2`/`full` (case-insensitive). Any other value is ignored and the rustc
level applies. `cargo oxide --device-debug` sets it, and the alias table lives
in `cuda-artifact-finalizer` so the build policy and the emitted DWARF cannot
disagree about what a value means.

`CUDA_OXIDE_DEVICE_ARCH` is a hint rather than an override: `cargo oxide`
sets it to the detected GPU's arch only when `--arch` was *not* passed. The
backend uses it as the build target when that GPU can run the kernel;
otherwise it builds for the architecture the kernel's features require
(tcgen05 and cta_group TMA multicast need `sm_100a`, which a consumer
`sm_120` lacks). An explicit `--arch` goes to `CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET` instead
and wins.

`CUDA_OXIDE_NO_FMA` and `CUDA_OXIDE_NO_SPILL_WARN` are presence-only: any
value, including the empty string, enables them. The first backs
`cargo oxide --no-fmad`; the second suppresses the post-`ptxas` register-spill
warning, which only fires when a native cubin is materialized.

`cargo oxide --arch <sm_XX>` sets `CUDA_OXIDE_TARGET`. When it is unset,
PTX output auto-detects the required target from generated LLVM IR.
Owner-filter names are normalized like Cargo crate names, so hyphens match
underscores. Host LLVM codegen still runs for every crate. An excluded target
must not call its generated module loader; the filter suppresses its device
artifact but does not give sibling targets separate runtime bundle names.

Examples starting with `error_` are expected to fail. See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)
for what each one tests and why it fails.

Run any example with:

```bash
cargo oxide run <example_name>

# See the full compilation pipeline
# (MIR → dialect-mir → LLVM dialect → LLVM IR → PTX)
cargo oxide pipeline <example_name>

## Key Design Decisions

- **Device code is `no_std`**. Functions reachable from a `#[kernel]` may only call into `core`, `cuda_device`, or the local crate. Use of `std` or `alloc` is a compile-time error.
- **Device code sees the host's target**. Kernels are compiled from the MIR of the single host-target rustc session, so `cfg(target_arch = ...)`, `cfg(target_feature = ...)`, and `usize` inside a kernel answer for the host, and struct layouts agree with the host by construction. Two guards keep that honest:
  - the backend refuses targets that are not 64-bit little-endian, which is what PTX is;
  - the collector rejects the two host-CPU signals a kernel can reach, `core::arch::<host>` intrinsics and `#[target_feature]` functions, as a compile-time error at the call rather than a translator failure. Raw `asm!` inlined from a helper is the remaining route; it still fails in the translator.
- **Arguments are scalarized** at the host/device boundary. Aggregates (slices, structs) are flattened to scalars for the CUDA launch ABI and reconstructed inside the kernel. This is transparent to the user.
- **Struct layout matches rustc exactly**. Device-side structs use explicit padding derived from rustc's layout queries, so `#[repr(C)]` is not required.
- **Closures work**. Both `move` closures (capture by value) and non-move closures (capture by reference via HMM) can be passed to kernels.
- **Unwind paths are unreachable**. The backend ignores all MIR unwind edges, so `panic=abort` and custom sysroots are unnecessary. If a panic condition is hit at runtime, the GPU traps.

### Nightly Rust

The backend uses `#![feature(rustc_private)]` and pins to a specific nightly via `rust-toolchain.toml`. The workspace currently uses `nightly-2026-08-28`.

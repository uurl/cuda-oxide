//! Regression for issue #137.
//!
//! `u32::carrying_mul_add(self, rhs, carry, add)` computes
//! `self * rhs + carry + add` exactly and returns the double-wide result as
//! a `(low, high)` pair. In MIR the method body is a call to the rustc
//! intrinsic `core::intrinsics::carrying_mul_add`, which the importer had
//! no dispatch arm for. The call fell through to a regular `mir.call`
//! against the intrinsic's mangled symbol, which the collector never
//! defines (it skips `InstanceKind::Intrinsic` by design), so the build
//! failed late with "Symbol ... not found" from the LLVM dialect verifier.
//!
//! The fix lowers the intrinsic the same way core's fallback does: widen
//! the four operands to double width, compute `a * b + c + d` (which
//! cannot overflow 2N bits), and split the wide value into `(low, high)`.
//! NVPTX folds that idiom into `mul.lo` / `mul.hi` / `mad` instructions.
//!
//! The stable methods `carrying_mul` and `carrying_mul_add` (unsigned) and
//! the unstable signed `carrying_mul_add` all funnel into this single
//! intrinsic, so they are all exercised here, with literal arguments (the
//! exact shape from the issue) and with host-supplied runtime arguments
//! (which cannot be const-folded away before reaching the importer).
//!
//! Build and run with:
//!   cargo oxide run carrying_mul_add

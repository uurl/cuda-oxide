//! Kernel library whose `#[cuda_module]` lives in a *library* crate.
//!
//! This is the regression shape for issue #72: the kernels here are
//! concrete (non-generic), so their PTX is compiled and embedded while
//! *this* crate is built, and the resulting artifact object becomes a
//! member of this crate's `.rlib`. The application crate then loads the
//! module by bundle name with `kernels::load(&ctx)`, which looks up this
//! crate's `CARGO_PKG_NAME` ("module-kernels") in the final binary's
//! `.oxart` section.
//!
//! Before the fix, the artifact archive member defined no symbols, so the
//! linker never extracted it and `load()` failed at runtime with
//! `ModuleNotFound { name: "module-kernels" }`. The fix adds a link-anchor
//! symbol to the artifact object and a matching reference in the generated
//! `load_named()`, which forces the extraction.
//!
//! The package name deliberately contains a hyphen so the symbol-name
//! sanitization (hyphen to underscore) is exercised too.

//! GPU Hashmap v2 — SwissTable-Inspired
//!
//! A `u32 -> u32` GPU hashmap that ports the three structural ideas
//! behind hashbrown's SwissTable to a CUDA backend:
//!   - A separate control-byte array (`ctrl: DeviceBuffer<u32>` packing 4
//!     1-byte tags per word) so probe walks examine fingerprints, not the
//!     full `(key, value)` payload.
//!   - hashbrown's h1/h2 hash split — h1 picks the probe position, h2 is a
//!     7-bit per-slot fingerprint stored in the tag.
//!   - Triangular probing in 32-tag-byte tiles (`PROBE_TILE`). Insert,
//!     find, and delete all walk the same triangular sequence so any
//!     key insert places is always reachable by find.
//!   - Tombstone delete (`FULL(h2)` -> `DELETED (0x80)` via `u32` CAS).
//!   - Warp-cooperative find (`find_kernel_warp`) — one warp per key,
//!     32 tag bytes inspected in parallel via `warp::ballot`.
//!
//! Two insert protocols ship side by side so the bench binary can
//! measure them head-to-head:
//!
//!   - **Protocol B (payload-first)** — one `DeviceAtomicU64::
//!     compare_exchange` on the slot followed by one
//!     `DeviceAtomicU32::compare_exchange` on the ctrl word. The slot
//!     CAS is the serialization point. Concurrent inserts of the same
//!     key in the same launch always see each other via `Err(actual)`
//!     and degenerate into the duplicate-handling path.
//!   - **Protocol A (ctrl-first, RESERVED handshake)** — one ctrl-byte
//!     CAS `EMPTY -> RESERVED` claims the slot exclusively, a plain
//!     release store writes the slot payload, then a second ctrl-byte
//!     CAS `RESERVED -> FULL(h2)` publishes the entry. No CAS on the
//!     slot itself. Across kernel launches (stream sync between insert
//!     and any further insert/find), Protocol A is observably
//!     equivalent to Protocol B; within a single launch, two threads
//!     racing to insert the same key may each claim a different
//!     RESERVED byte and end up publishing two slots for that key.
//!     Subsequent finds remain internally consistent (same probe
//!     order, same hit). The duplicate is the documented cost of
//!     skipping the slot CAS.
//!
//! Find observers (single-thread and warp-cooperative) treat the four
//! tag values as: `FULL(h2)` -> peek the slot, `EMPTY` -> terminate
//! probe with MISS, `DELETED` and `RESERVED` -> advance within tile.
//! `RESERVED` does NOT terminate (the slot may be in flight) and does
//! NOT match h2 (its top bit is 1, h2's is 0), so the existing find
//! kernels handle it correctly without special-casing.
//!
//! Library crate: kernels, device-side helpers, and the host-side
//! `GpuSwissMap` driver are defined here so two binaries in the same
//! package can reuse them — `main` (correctness tests) and `bench`
//! (head-to-head perf vs CPU `hashbrown::HashMap`).
//!
//! Build and run the tests with:
//!   cargo oxide run hashmap_v2
//!
//! Run the bench with:
//!   ./crates/rustc-codegen-cuda/examples/hashmap_v2/run-bench.sh

///     same triangular sequence — otherwise find can terminate early
///     on an `EMPTY` slot that insert had skipped, missing valid keys.

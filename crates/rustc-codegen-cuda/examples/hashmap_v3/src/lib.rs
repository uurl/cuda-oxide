//! GPU Hashmap v3 — SwissTable, Cooperative-Groups Edition
//!
//! A `u32 -> u32` GPU hashmap built on the typed cooperative-groups API:
//!   - A separate control-byte array (`ctrl: DeviceBuffer<u32>` packing 4
//!     1-byte tags per word) so probe walks examine fingerprints, not the
//!     full `(key, value)` payload.
//!   - hashbrown's h1/h2 hash split — h1 picks the probe position, h2 is a
//!     7-bit per-slot fingerprint stored in the tag.
//!   - Triangular probing in `PROBE_TILE`-byte tiles. Insert, find,
//!     and delete all walk the same triangular sequence so any key
//!     insert places is always reachable by find.
//!   - Tombstone delete (`FULL(h2)` -> `DELETED (0x80)` via `u32` CAS).
//!   - Warp-cooperative find on the typed cooperative-groups API,
//!     parameterised over a `WarpTile<N>` lane-tile size (`N = 32`
//!     for one query per warp, `N = 16` for two queries per warp).
//!
//! Insert is payload-first when claiming a fresh `EMPTY` slot:
//! `DeviceAtomicU64::compare_exchange` on the slot first, then
//! `DeviceAtomicU32::compare_exchange` to flip the ctrl byte to
//! `FULL(h2)`. The slot CAS is the serialization point —
//! concurrent inserts of the same key in the same launch always see
//! each other via `Err(actual)` and degenerate into the duplicate-
//! handling path.
//!
//! Insert also reclaims `DELETED` slots. While walking Phase 2,
//! insert remembers the first `DELETED` byte it sees in the chain.
//! On hitting `EMPTY` it claims the remembered `DELETED` (if any)
//! via a two-stage handshake: tag-CAS `DELETED -> RESERVED` to
//! exclude other claimers, plain release-store the new
//! `(key, value)` payload over the stale data, then tag-CAS
//! `RESERVED -> FULL(h2)` to publish. The reclaim slot lies before
//! the chain's first `EMPTY`, so find's `EMPTY`-termination invariant
//! is preserved (find walks the chain in order, hits the
//! now-`FULL` reclaimed slot before any `EMPTY` further down).
//!
//! Find observers treat the four tag values as: `FULL(h2)` -> peek
//! the slot, `EMPTY` -> terminate probe with MISS, `DELETED` and
//! `RESERVED` -> advance within tile. `RESERVED` (top bit set,
//! distinct from `EMPTY` and `DELETED`) does NOT terminate find and
//! does NOT match h2, so the find kernels need no special-casing.
//!
//! Library crate: kernels, device-side helpers, and the host-side
//! `GpuSwissMap` driver are defined here so two binaries in the same
//! package can reuse them — `main` (correctness tests) and `bench`
//! (head-to-head perf vs CPU `hashbrown::HashMap`).
//!
//! Build and run the tests with:
//!   cargo oxide run hashmap_v3
//!
//! Run the bench with:
//!   ./crates/rustc-codegen-cuda/examples/hashmap_v3/run-bench.sh

///   - Insert and find MUST share `PROBE_TILE` so they walk the same

///     `EMPTY` slot that insert had skipped, missing valid keys.
///   - `PROBE_TILE` must be a multiple of `GROUP` (one ctrl word covers
///     `GROUP` tag bytes; we read `PROBE_TILE / GROUP` ctrl words per
///     step).

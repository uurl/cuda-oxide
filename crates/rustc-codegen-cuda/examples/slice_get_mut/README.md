# slice_get_mut

Regression example for issue #58: mutable element writes through
slice-shaped (fat) pointers were rejected by the mir-importer.

A `&mut [T]` is a fat pointer: at the ABI level it is a (data pointer,
length) pair, not a single address. Calling `a.get_mut(i)` on a
`&mut [f32; N]` first unsizes the array reference to a fat `&mut [f32]`,
and the inlined `slice::get_mut` body then takes `&mut (*fat)[i]`, i.e.
the place projection chain `[Deref, Index(i)]` over the fat local.

Before the fix, the address walker refused that chain:

```text
Unsupported construct: cannot compute a mutable in-memory address through
fat-pointer deref (projection [Deref, Index(10)]); slices scalarize to
(ptr, len) and a single load would misread the fat value as a thin address
```

and the direct assignment form `a[i] = v` failed separately with
"2-level projection Deref -> Index(...) not yet implemented for
assignment".

The fix loads the whole fat value, extracts field 0 (the thin data
pointer, which addresses the ORIGINAL elements), and continues the
projection walk with a plain pointer offset, so both shared and mutable
borrows stay sound.

## Kernels

| Kernel                       | Shape pinned                                |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| `write_get_mut_map`          | `a.get_mut(i).map(\|e\| *e = v)` (issue #58) |
| `write_get_mut_if_let`       | `if let Some(e) = a.get_mut(i)`             |
| `write_index_assign`         | `a[i] = v` through thin `&mut [f32; N]`     |
| `write_slice_index_assign`   | `s[i] = v` through fat `&mut [f32]`         |
| `write_mut_ref_index`        | `&mut a[i]` write (pre-existing guard)      |
| `write_struct_field_get_mut` | `get_mut` on `[Cell; 2]`, then field write  |

Each kernel writes a distinct, index-dependent pattern into a zeroed
buffer; the host reads everything back and checks every lane, so a write
that lands in a temporary copy (or always in lane 0) fails loudly. The
harness prints `PASS` per kernel, a final `SUCCESS` marker when all pass,
and exits non-zero otherwise.

## Build & run

From the cuda-oxide repository root:

```bash
cargo oxide run slice_get_mut
cargo oxide pipeline slice_get_mut    # dump MIR + LLVM IR
```

Requires a CUDA-capable GPU and the cuda-oxide rustc toolchain.

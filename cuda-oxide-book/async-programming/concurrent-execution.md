# Concurrent Execution

You know how to describe GPU work with `DeviceOperation`, compose multi-stage
pipelines with `and_then` and `zip!`, and let the scheduling policy assign
streams. Now comes the payoff: running multiple pipelines **at the same time**.
This chapter walks through the `async_mlp` example end to end, showing how
Tokio tasks, the round-robin scheduler, and Rust's ownership model come
together to process four batches concurrently on one GPU.

## The scenario

You are running a three-layer MLP forward pass: **GEMM** (matrix multiply),
**MatVec** (matrix-vector product), and **ReLU** (activation). You have two
weight matrices loaded on the GPU and four batches of input data to process.
Each batch is independent -- batch 0 does not depend on batch 1 -- but they all
share the same weights.

```{figure} images/concurrent-batches.svg

:width: 100%

Four MLP forward passes running concurrently. Top: shared weights uploaded
once as `Arc<DeviceBox>`, cloned cheaply into each batch. Middle: the GPU
timeline — round-robin distributes batches across four streams, and the
staggered pipelines overlap. Bottom: sequential processing takes ~4× the
time of one batch; concurrent processing takes ~1.3× if the GPU has spare SMs.
```

The sequential approach processes one batch at a time:

```text
Batch 0:  ████ GEMM ████ MatVec ██ ReLU █ D2H █
                                                  Batch 1:  ████ GEMM ████ ...
```

The concurrent approach overlaps them across streams:

```text
Stream 0:  ████ GEMM ████ MatVec ██ ReLU █ D2H █
Stream 1:    ████ GEMM ████ MatVec ██ ReLU █ D2H █
Stream 2:      ████ GEMM ████ MatVec ██ ReLU █ D2H █
Stream 3:        ████ GEMM ████ MatVec ██ ReLU █ D2H █
```

If the GPU has enough SMs to run multiple kernels simultaneously, the
overlapped version finishes significantly faster. And because each pipeline is
a single `and_then` chain on one stream, stages within a batch are still
strictly ordered -- no cross-stream synchronization needed.

## Step 1: Initialize the runtime

Everything starts with `init_device_contexts`. This creates the CUDA context,
sets up the scheduling policy (round-robin with four streams by default), and
makes the thread-local state available for `.sync()` and `.await`:

```rust
use cuda_async::simt::device_context::init_device_contexts;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    init_device_contexts(0, 1)?;
    let module = kernels::load_async(0)?;
```

The embedded module is loaded through the thread-local async context. The typed
module handle can be cloned cheaply into each batch pipeline.

## Step 2: Upload shared weights

The model has two weight matrices: W0 (DIM x DIM) and W1 (DIM). Both need to
live on the device for the duration of all four forward passes. This is where
`zip!` and `.arc()` earn their keep:

```rust
    let w0_host: Vec<f32> = (0..DIM * DIM)
        .map(|i| ((i % 7) as f32 - 3.0) * 0.01)
        .collect();
    let w1_host: Vec<f32> = (0..DIM)
        .map(|i| ((i % 5) as f32 - 2.0) * 0.01)
        .collect();

    let (w0, w1): (Arc<DeviceBox<[f32]>>, Arc<DeviceBox<[f32]>>) = zip!(
        h2d(w0_host).arc(),
        h2d(w1_host).arc()
    ).await?;
```

`zip!` bundles two independent H2D transfers into one operation. `.arc()` wraps
each result in `Arc` so the weights can be shared. `.await` schedules the
combined operation on one of the pool's streams and waits for it to complete.

After this line, `w0` and `w1` are `Arc<DeviceBox<[f32]>>` -- cheap to clone,
safe to share, and pinned on the device.

## Step 3: Build and spawn batch pipelines

Now the interesting part. For each batch, you build a lazy pipeline (no GPU
work yet) and hand it to `tokio::spawn`:

```rust
    let num_batches = 4;
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for batch_idx in 0..num_batches {
        let w0 = w0.clone();       // Arc clone: ~1 ns
        let w1 = w1.clone();
        let module = module.clone();

        let batch_data: Vec<f32> = (0..DIM * DIM)
            .map(|i| ((i + batch_idx * 37) % 13) as f32 * 0.1)
            .collect();

        let pipeline = zip!(h2d(batch_data), zeros(DIM * DIM), zeros(DIM))
            .and_then(move |(input, hidden, output)| {
                // Stage 1: GEMM — hidden = input × W0
                // ... build + finalize an owned launch, then chain with and_then ...
            })
            .and_then(move |(hidden, output, w1, module)| {
                // Stage 2: MatVec — output = hidden × W1
                // ...
            })
            .and_then(move |(output, module)| {
                // Stage 3: ReLU — result = max(0, output)
                // ...
            })
            .and_then(d2h);  // Stage 4: copy result to host

        handles.push(tokio::spawn(pipeline.into_future()));
    }
```

Let's unpack what happens here:

1. **`pipeline` is a `DeviceOperation`.** It describes the entire forward pass
   but performs no GPU work. Building it is pure host-side computation --
   allocating closures and structs.

2. **`.into_future()` converts it to a `DeviceFuture`.** This triggers the
   scheduling policy, which picks a stream. Batch 0 gets stream 0, batch 1
   gets stream 1, and so on -- round-robin.

3. **`tokio::spawn` hands the future to the Tokio runtime.** The runtime will
   poll it when the executor has capacity. On the first poll, the pipeline's
   `execute()` runs, submitting all the GPU work to the assigned stream.

4. **The runtime is free.** After the first poll, the task is parked. The GPU
   is crunching numbers on four streams simultaneously. No host thread sits
   waiting.

5. **When the GPU finishes** a pipeline's work, the `cuLaunchHostFunc` callback
   fires, waking the corresponding Tokio task. The runtime re-polls it,
   delivering the `Vec<f32>` result.

## Step 4: Collect results

```rust
    for (i, handle) in handles.into_iter().enumerate() {
        let result: Vec<f32> = handle.await??;
        println!("Batch {}: {} elements, first 4 = {:?}",
            i, result.len(), &result[..4]);
    }
```

The double `?` unwraps two layers: the outer `JoinError` (in case the Tokio
task panicked) and the inner `DeviceError` (in case GPU work failed). In a
production system you would handle these separately.

## `.await` vs `.sync()` vs `tokio::spawn`

Having seen all three in action, here is when to reach for each:

**`.sync()`** blocks the calling thread until the GPU finishes. Use it in
scripts, tests, and anywhere you do not have an async runtime. Simple, no
ceremony, but no concurrency either -- the host thread is stuck waiting:

```rust
let result = pipeline.sync()?;
```

**`.await`** yields the current async task while the GPU works. Other tasks on
the same Tokio thread can make progress. This is better than `.sync()` for
throughput but still sequential within the task -- the code after `.await` does
not run until the operation completes:

```rust
let result = pipeline.await?;
```

**`tokio::spawn(op.into_future())`** launches the pipeline as a fully
independent task. The spawning code continues immediately, and the result
arrives later via the join handle. This is the way to achieve true concurrency
-- multiple pipelines running on different streams at the same time:

```rust
let handle = tokio::spawn(pipeline.into_future());
// ... spawn more pipelines, do other work ...
let result = handle.await??;
```

:::{tip}
For a chain of dependent operations (like the four-stage forward pass),
prefer `and_then` over sequential `.await`s. An `and_then` chain runs
entirely on one stream with zero scheduling overhead between stages.
Sequential `.await`s go through the scheduling policy for each operation,
potentially landing on different streams and requiring cross-stream
synchronization.

## Ownership patterns

Concurrent GPU programming in Rust means Rust's ownership rules are actively
working for you -- and occasionally getting in your way. Here are the patterns
that come up repeatedly.

### Moving data through `and_then` closures

Each `and_then` closure captures data by `move`. The kernel launch produces
`()`, so you need to explicitly carry forward the buffers the next stage needs:

```rust
launch_gemm(input, hidden, w0)
    .and_then(move |()| {
        // input is consumed by the kernel. hidden and module survive
        // because they were captured but not consumed.
        value((hidden, output, w1, module))
    })
```

The closure returns a `Value` containing a tuple of everything the next stage
needs. This tuple is the "baton" passed between stages.

### Sharing immutable data with `Arc`

Model weights, lookup tables, and other immutable data shared across pipelines
should be wrapped in `Arc`. The `.arc()` combinator does this automatically for
a `DeviceOperation`'s output. For data you already have, `Arc::new()` works:

```rust
let weights = h2d(weight_data).arc().await?;  // Arc<DeviceBox<[f32]>>
for batch in batches {
    let w = weights.clone();  // cheap reference-count bump
    tokio::spawn(forward_pass(batch, w).into_future());
}
```

### Keeping device memory alive

A `DeviceBox` must stay alive until the GPU is done using it. In `and_then`
chains this is automatic -- the closure owns the `DeviceBox`, and it lives until
the next stage takes it. The danger is `with_context` closures where you perform
an async copy and the `DeviceBox` might be dropped before the copy completes:

```rust
fn d2h(dev: DeviceBox<[f32]>) -> impl DeviceOperation<Output = Vec<f32>> {
    with_context(move |ctx| {
        let stream = ctx.get_cuda_stream();
        let mut host = vec![0.0f32; dev.len()];
        unsafe {
            memcpy_dtoh_async(
                host.as_mut_ptr(), dev.cu_deviceptr(),
                dev.len() * std::mem::size_of::<f32>(),
                stream.cu_stream(),
            ).unwrap();
        }
        // dev is captured by the closure and lives until the closure returns.
        // The stream will synchronize before the result is consumed,
        // so the async copy completes before dev is dropped.
        value(host)
    })
}
```

The key: `dev` is captured by the `move` closure and is not dropped until the
closure returns. Since the stream synchronizes before the `DeviceFuture`
delivers the result, the async copy finishes before `dev` is freed.

(concurrent-error-handling)=

## Error handling

Errors from GPU work propagate through the `Result` chain just like any Rust
code. When running concurrent batches, you typically want to continue processing
even if one batch fails:

```rust
for (i, handle) in handles.into_iter().enumerate() {
    match handle.await {
        Ok(Ok(result)) => {
            println!("Batch {i}: {} elements", result.len());
        }
        Ok(Err(device_err)) => {
            eprintln!("Batch {i}: GPU error: {device_err}");
        }
        Err(join_err) => {
            eprintln!("Batch {i}: task panicked: {join_err}");
        }
    }
}
```

The three arms correspond to: success, a CUDA driver or scheduling error
(e.g., out-of-memory, invalid launch config), and a Tokio task panic.

## Multi-device execution

For systems with multiple GPUs, pass a higher device count to
`init_device_contexts`:

```rust
init_device_contexts(0, 2)?;  // default device 0, capacity for 2 devices
```

This sets the default device to GPU 0 and prepares the thread-local map for
two devices. Each device's CUDA context, scheduling policy, and stream pool are
created lazily on first use. All policy-driven operations (`.sync()`, `.await`)
use the default device unless you explicitly target a different one. The
`ExecutionContext` carries the device ID, so operations on GPU 0 never
interfere with streams on GPU 1.

:::{tip}
Multi-device programming requires attention to memory placement. A
`DeviceBox` allocated on GPU 0 is not accessible from GPU 1 unless peer
access is enabled. Use `with_context` to check `ctx.get_device_id()` when
building device-specific operations.

## Performance tuning

### Stream pool sizing

The default pool of four streams works well for most workloads, but if you are
chasing the last few percent of throughput, the right pool size depends on your
situation:

| Workload                      | Suggested pool size | Why                                       |
|:------------------------------|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| One large kernel per launch   | 1--2                | The kernel already saturates the GPU      |
| Many small kernels            | 4--8                | Overlap launch overhead between streams   |
| Mixed kernel + memcpy         | 2--4                | Overlap compute with data transfer        |
| Latency-sensitive serving     | 1 per request       | Avoid head-of-line blocking               |

### Profiling

Nsight Systems is the standard tool for visualizing stream occupancy:

```bash
nsys profile --trace=cuda cargo oxide run async_mlp
nsys-ui report.nsys-rep
```

Look for gaps between kernels on the same stream (launch overhead), idle
streams in the pool (unbalanced work distribution), and unexpected
serialization across streams (missing or extra dependencies).

### Common pitfalls

| Pitfall                                | What you see                                         | Fix                                          |
|:---------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `.sync()` inside an async context      | Blocks the Tokio thread, stalling all tasks on it    | Use `.await` instead                         |
| `DeviceBox` dropped before stream sync | Use-after-free crash or corrupted results            | Keep ownership in `and_then` closures        |
| Too many streams                       | Scheduling overhead exceeds overlap benefit          | Profile, reduce pool size                    |
| Missing `init_device_contexts`         | `DeviceError::Context` on first operation            | Call once at program start                   |

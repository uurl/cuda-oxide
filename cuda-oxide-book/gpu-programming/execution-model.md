# The CUDA Execution Model

This chapter covers the CUDA SIMT execution model -- how work is organized into
threads, warps, blocks, and grids -- and how cuda-oxide exposes each level
through safe, ergonomic Rust APIs.

## Threads, blocks, and grids

Every kernel launch creates a **grid** of **thread blocks**.
The three-level hierarchy is the foundation of GPU programming:

| Level     | What it is                             | Size                                 | Key property                            |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| **Grid**  | All blocks launched by one kernel call | Up to 2³¹ - 1 blocks per dimension   | Blocks execute independently            |
| **Block** | A group of threads that can cooperate  | Up to 1024 threads                   | Threads share fast on-chip memory       |
| **Warp**  | 32 consecutive threads within a block  | Always 32                            | Execute instructions in lockstep (SIMT) |

A kernel launch specifies two things: how many blocks in the grid (the **grid
dimensions**) and how many threads in each block (the **block dimensions**). The
hardware then groups every 32 consecutive threads into warps automatically -- you
never create warps explicitly.

## Thread indexing in cuda-oxide

Inside a kernel, every thread needs to know *which* element it should work on.
CUDA provides built-in variables (`threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, `blockDim`,
`gridDim`); cuda-oxide wraps these in the `cuda_device::thread` module:

```rust
use cuda_device::{kernel, thread, DisjointSlice};

#[kernel]
pub fn vecadd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], mut c: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
    let idx = thread::index_1d();
    if let Some(c_elem) = c.get_mut(idx) {
        *c_elem = a[idx.get()] + b[idx.get()];
    }
}
```

`thread::index_1d()` computes `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x`. It maps
threads to distinct array elements when grid and block Y/Z dimensions are 1.
That is the common shape for 1D data-parallel kernels; a `domain = 1` prepared
launch proves it.

For cases where you need individual components, cuda-oxide exposes the raw
accessors:

| cuda-oxide API           | Equivalent CUDA C++                      | Returns                            |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| `thread::index_1d()`     | `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x`  | Global 1D thread index             |
| `thread::threadIdx_x()`  | `threadIdx.x`                            | Thread's position within its block |
| `thread::blockIdx_x()`   | `blockIdx.x`                             | Block's position within the grid   |
| `thread::blockDim_x()`   | `blockDim.x`                             | Number of threads per block (x)    |

:::{tip}
For multi-dimensional indexing (e.g., 2D matrix operations), use `threadIdx_y()`,
`blockIdx_y()`, and `blockDim_y()` alongside the `_x` variants to compute
row/column indices.

## Warps and SIMT execution

A **warp** is the fundamental scheduling unit on NVIDIA GPUs. Every 32
consecutive threads in a block form one warp, and all 32 threads in a warp
execute the **same instruction** at the **same time** -- but on **different
data**. This model is called **SIMT** (Single Instruction, Multiple Thread).

When all threads in a warp follow the same control-flow path, the warp achieves
full throughput. When threads diverge (different threads take different `if`
branches), the hardware serializes the paths: it executes one branch with some
threads masked off, then the other branch, then reconverges. This is called
**branch divergence** and it directly reduces throughput.

```{figure} images/simt-warp-execution.svg
:align: center
:width: 100%

Left: uniform execution where all 32 threads run the same instruction in one
cycle. Right: branch divergence where even and odd threads take different
paths, requiring two serial passes.
```

### Why this matters

You don't need to think about warps to write *correct* kernels -- cuda-oxide
handles the details. But understanding SIMT helps you write *fast* ones:

- **Prefer uniform control flow.** When all threads in a warp evaluate the
  same branch, there is no divergence penalty.
- **Data-dependent branches are fine** as long as nearby threads (those in the
  same warp) tend to take the same path.
- **Avoid thread-ID-based branching** like `if thread::threadIdx_x() % 2 == 0`
  inside hot loops -- this guarantees every warp diverges.

## Hardware mapping

When you launch a kernel, the GPU's hardware scheduler assigns each block to a
**Streaming Multiprocessor** (SM). Multiple blocks can run concurrently on the
same SM -- the exact number depends on the block's resource usage (registers,
shared memory, threads).

The key insight: **you control the grid and block dimensions; the hardware
controls everything else.** You never specify which SM runs which block, or in
what order blocks execute. This separation is what lets the same kernel scale
from a laptop GPU with a handful of SMs to a data-center GPU with 100+.

```{figure} images/simt-hardware-mapping.svg
:align: center
:width: 100%

Eight blocks assigned to four SMs by the GPU scheduler. Each SM has its own
warp schedulers, CUDA cores, and shared memory/L1 cache. Blocks 4-7 (dashed
arrows) run after blocks 0-3 complete or are queued alongside them if
resources permit.
```

### What limits concurrency

Each SM has a fixed pool of resources. A block is assigned to an SM only if the
SM has enough of *all* of the following:

| Resource      | Typical limit (Ampere)       | Controlled by       |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------|:--------------------|
| Threads       | 2048 per SM                  | `block_dim`         |
| Registers     | 65536 per SM                 | Compiler allocation |
| Shared memory | 164 KB per SM (configurable) | `shared_mem_bytes`  |
| Block slots   | 32 per SM                    | Grid size           |

When a block finishes, its resources are freed and the scheduler immediately
assigns a queued block to that SM. This is why launching *more* blocks than the
GPU has SMs is not just okay -- it's the normal and expected pattern.

## Launch configuration

On the host side, `LaunchConfig` tells the runtime how to shape the grid:

```rust
use cuda_core::simt::LaunchConfig;

// Quick 1D launch: 256 threads per block, enough blocks to cover N elements
let cfg = LaunchConfig::for_num_elems(N as u32);
```

`for_num_elems` uses a block size of 256 and computes the grid size via ceiling
division -- the right default for most element-wise kernels. For more control,
construct `LaunchConfig` directly:

```rust
let cfg = LaunchConfig {
    grid_dim: (4, 4, 1),      // 4×4 = 16 blocks
    block_dim: (16, 16, 1),   // 16×16 = 256 threads per block
    shared_mem_bytes: 0,       // no dynamic shared memory
};
```

Then pass it to the generated raw launch method. The call is unsafe because
`LaunchConfig` itself does not prove that hidden Y/Z dimensions are inactive:

```rust
// SAFETY: `for_num_elems` is 1D and all three buffers contain N elements.
unsafe {
    module.vecadd(
        &stream,
        LaunchConfig::for_num_elems(N as u32),
        &a_dev,
        &b_dev,
        &mut c_dev,
    )
}
.expect("Kernel launch failed");
```

Or with the async API:

```rust
// SAFETY: this is 1D, buffers contain N elements, and module/scheduler share a context.
unsafe {
    module.vecadd_async(
        LaunchConfig::for_num_elems(N as u32),
        &a_dev,
        &b_dev,
        &mut c_dev,
    )
}?
.sync()?;
```

### Choosing block size

The block size is the single most important tuning knob:

- **256 threads** is a safe default. It balances occupancy (multiple blocks per
  SM) with register pressure on most architectures.
- **Powers of 2** (128, 256, 512) align naturally with warp boundaries and
  avoid wasting threads.
- **Too small** (< 128) may leave warp schedulers underutilized.
- **Too large** (1024) uses the full block thread limit, which may reduce the
  number of concurrent blocks per SM.

The grid size follows from the block size and the problem size:
`grid_x = (N + block_x - 1) / block_x`. This is exactly what
`LaunchConfig::for_num_elems` computes.

### Bounds checking

Because the grid size is rounded up, some threads will have indices beyond the
array length. cuda-oxide's `DisjointSlice` handles this safely -- `get_mut`
returns `None` for out-of-bounds indices, so those threads simply do nothing:

```rust
#[kernel]
pub fn vecadd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], mut c: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
    let idx = thread::index_1d();
    if let Some(c_elem) = c.get_mut(idx) {   // out-of-bounds threads skip
        *c_elem = a[idx.get()] + b[idx.get()];
    }
}
```

This is a deliberate departure from CUDA C++, where bounds-checking is the
programmer's responsibility. cuda-oxide's approach eliminates an entire class of
out-of-bounds memory bugs at the cost of a single branch (which is uniform
across the warp for all but the last block).

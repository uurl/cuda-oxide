# Project: Async MLP Pipeline

You have learned how to define kernels, move data, compose operations with
combinators, and schedule work across streams. Time to put it all together.

This chapter walks through `async_mlp` — the most complete example in the
cuda-oxide repository — from the first `use` statement to the final
`[ReLU OK]` on stdout. By the end you will have built a multi-kernel GPU
pipeline that processes four batches concurrently, using every async pattern
in the toolkit. If you have been reading the chapters sequentially, consider
this the final boss.

:::{seealso}
The [Concurrent Execution](../async-programming/concurrent-execution.md)
chapter covers the *concepts* behind concurrent pipelines in depth. This
chapter focuses on the *code* — a complete, buildable project you can run,
modify, and profile.

## What we are building

A toy **multi-layer perceptron (MLP) forward pass** on the GPU:

```text
input [64×64]  ──►  GEMM(input, W0)  ──►  hidden [64×64]
                                              │
                            MatVec(hidden, W1) ──►  output [64]
                                                       │
                                                 ReLU(output) ──►  result [64]
```

Three kernels, four stages (including the final device-to-host copy), four
batches, four CUDA streams, one shared set of weights, and zero host threads
sitting around waiting. Here is the big picture:

```{figure} ../async-programming/images/concurrent-batches.svg
:align: center
:width: 100%

Four MLP forward passes running concurrently. Shared weights are uploaded
once as `Arc<DeviceBox>` and cloned cheaply into each batch. The round-robin
scheduler distributes batches across four streams, and the staggered
pipelines overlap on the GPU timeline.
```

The sequential approach processes one batch at a time — four times the work,
four times the wait. The concurrent approach overlaps them: if the GPU has
spare SMs, you finish in roughly the time of a single batch plus a small
stagger. Not a bad return on a handful of `Arc::clone()` calls.

---

## Project structure

The example lives at `crates/rustc-codegen-cuda/examples/async_mlp/` and is a
standalone Cargo workspace member:

```text
async_mlp/
├── Cargo.toml        ← dependencies: cuda-device, cuda-core, cuda-async, tokio
└── src/
    └── main.rs       ← kernels + host code, single file
```

Everything — device kernels and host orchestration — lives in one file. The
`#[kernel]` attribute tells the compiler which functions become PTX; the rest
compiles as normal Rust. No separate `.cu` files, no header gymnastics, no
build-system split personality.

### Dependencies

The `Cargo.toml` pulls in exactly the crates we need:

```toml
[dependencies]
cuda-device   = { path = "../../../cuda-device" }       # #[kernel], DisjointSlice, thread::*
cuda-core     = "0.3.1"                                 # shared with cutile-rs: CudaModule, simt::LaunchConfig
cuda-async    = "0.3.1"                                 # shared with cutile-rs: simt::DeviceOperation, zip!, and_then
tokio       = { version = "1", features = ["rt", "macros"] }
```

`cuda-device` provides the device-side API (intrinsics, safe mutable slices).
`cuda-core` handles module loading and launch configuration.
`cuda-async` provides the `DeviceOperation` graph, combinators, and the
stream-pool scheduler. `tokio` is the host async runtime that polls the
futures.

---

## The GPU kernels

These three functions are compiled to PTX by `rustc-codegen-cuda`. They never
execute on the host — the `#[kernel]` attribute renames each one to
`cuda_oxide_kernel_<hash>_<name>` so the codegen backend can identify and extract
them.

### sgemm_naive — matrix multiply

```rust
use cuda_device::{kernel, thread, DisjointSlice};

use cuda_device::thread::Runtime2DIndex;

#[kernel]
pub fn sgemm_naive(
    m: u32, n: u32, k: u32,
    alpha: f32, a: &[f32], b: &[f32],
    beta: f32, mut c: DisjointSlice<f32, Runtime2DIndex>,
) {
    let row = thread::index_2d_row();
    let col = thread::index_2d_col();

    // The row width comes from `c`, bound on the host to this same `n`.
    if let Some(c_idx) = thread::index_2d_runtime(&c) {
        // col < n guaranteed by `Some` -- no manual check needed
        if row < m as usize {
            let n_sz = n as usize;
            let k_sz = k as usize;
            let mut sum = 0.0f32;
            let mut i = 0usize;
            while i < k_sz {
                sum = sum + a[row * k_sz + i] * b[i * n_sz + col];
                i = i + 1;
            }
            if let Some(c_elem) = c.get_mut(c_idx) {
                *c_elem = alpha * sum + beta * (*c_elem);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Each thread computes one element of the output matrix. The 2D thread index
maps directly to the (row, col) position. `DisjointSlice` checks bounds and
requires the matching index-space type. `c`'s row width is not a per-call
argument: the host binds it into the slice once at launch, and
`index_2d_runtime(&c)` reads it back, so every thread resolves against the
same row width by construction. The remaining proof is explicit: Z is
inactive and the raw 2D launch shape matches the kernel.

:::{tip}
This is intentionally a *naive* GEMM — one thread, one element, no shared
memory tiling, no coalescing tricks. A production GEMM would use the
techniques from the [Shared Memory](../advanced/shared-memory-and-synchronization.md)
chapter. But for demonstrating async composition, correctness beats
performance.

### matvec_naive — matrix-vector product

```rust
#[kernel]
pub fn matvec_naive(
    _m: u32, n: u32,
    mat: &[f32], vec_in: &[f32],
    mut vec_out: DisjointSlice<f32>,
) {
    let row = thread::index_1d();
    if let Some(out_elem) = vec_out.get_mut(row) {
        let n_sz = n as usize;
        let mut sum = 0.0f32;
        let mut j = 0usize;
        while j < n_sz {
            sum = sum + mat[row.get() * n_sz + j] * vec_in[j];
            j = j + 1;
        }
        *out_elem = sum;
    }
}
```

One thread per output element, one-dimensional indexing. The `_m` parameter
is unused but keeps the calling convention consistent with BLAS-style
interfaces.

### relu — activation

```rust
#[kernel]
pub fn relu(input: &[f32], mut output: DisjointSlice<f32>) {
    let idx = thread::index_1d();
    if let Some(out_elem) = output.get_mut(idx) {
        let val = input[idx.get()];
        *out_elem = if val > 0.0f32 { val } else { 0.0f32 };
    }
}
```

Elementwise `max(0, x)`. In the pipeline, `input` and `output` point to the
same buffer — a perfectly valid in-place pattern since each thread reads and
writes the same index and the launch is 1D.

### What to notice

A few patterns that recur across all three kernels:

| Pattern                                   | What it does                                                                                               |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `thread::index_1d()` / `index_2d::<S>()`  | Computes the global thread index from block/grid dimensions                                                |
| `DisjointSlice<f32>`                      | Bounds-checked mutable output; launch geometry completes the uniqueness proof                              |
| `if let Some(elem) = slice.get_mut(idx)`  | Bounds check that silences threads beyond the data size                                                    |
| `while` loops instead of `for`            | Stylistic choice — `for` loops with ranges also work on device, but `while` makes the loop bounds explicit |

---

## Bridging host and device

Three helper functions wrap raw CUDA driver calls into `DeviceOperation`
values. They use `with_context` to receive the scheduler's stream at
execution time — not at the call site. This is the key insight: you build
the recipe now, the scheduler picks the stream later.

### h2d — host to device

```rust
fn h2d(host_data: Vec<f32>) -> impl DeviceOperation<Output = DeviceBox<[f32]>> {
    device_operation::with_context(move |ctx| {
        let stream = ctx.get_cuda_stream();
        let n = host_data.len();
        let num_bytes = n * mem::size_of::<f32>();
        unsafe {
            let dptr = malloc_async(stream.cu_stream(), num_bytes).unwrap();
            memcpy_htod_async(dptr, host_data.as_ptr(), num_bytes, stream.cu_stream())
                .unwrap();
            value(DeviceBox::from_raw_parts(dptr, n, ctx.get_device_id()))
        }
    })
}
```

The `host_data` vector is captured by `move`. The closure runs when the
scheduler executes the operation — at that point it has a real CUDA stream.
`malloc_async` and `memcpy_htod_async` are stream-ordered, so the allocation
and copy are serialized on the scheduler's chosen stream.

### zeros — zero-initialized device buffer

```rust
fn zeros(n: usize) -> impl DeviceOperation<Output = DeviceBox<[f32]>> {
    device_operation::with_context(move |ctx| {
        let stream = ctx.get_cuda_stream();
        let num_bytes = n * mem::size_of::<f32>();
        unsafe {
            let dptr = malloc_async(stream.cu_stream(), num_bytes).unwrap();
            memset_d8_async(dptr, 0, num_bytes, stream.cu_stream()).unwrap();
            value(DeviceBox::from_raw_parts(dptr, n, ctx.get_device_id()))
        }
    })
}
```

Same pattern as `h2d`, but `memset_d8_async` instead of `memcpy`. The GEMM
kernel uses `beta = 0.0` so the initial contents do not matter, but zeroing
is defensive.

### d2h — device to host

```rust
fn d2h(dev: DeviceBox<[f32]>) -> impl DeviceOperation<Output = Vec<f32>> {
    device_operation::with_context(move |ctx| {
        let stream = ctx.get_cuda_stream();
        let n = dev.len();
        let num_bytes = n * mem::size_of::<f32>();
        let mut host = vec![0.0f32; n];
        unsafe {
            memcpy_dtoh_async(
                host.as_mut_ptr(), dev.cu_deviceptr(),
                num_bytes, stream.cu_stream(),
            ).unwrap();
        }
        let _ = &dev;
        value(host)
    })
}
```

The `let _ = &dev;` line looks like a no-op, but it keeps `dev` alive in the
closure until the stream synchronizes. Without it, `dev` would be dropped
after the `memcpy_dtoh_async` call but before the stream finishes the copy —
a classic use-after-free on the device side.

---

## Composing the pipeline

Each batch is a single `DeviceOperation` built from combinators. No GPU
work happens when you assemble it — it is a lazy description of future work.
Here is how the pieces fit together:

```{figure} ../async-programming/images/combinator-dataflow.svg
:align: center
:width: 100%

The combinator pipeline for a single batch. `zip!` allocates three buffers
in parallel. The `and_then` chain sequences GEMM → MatVec → ReLU → D2H,
threading device handles through each stage via `value()`.
```

### Step 1: Initialize the runtime

```rust
const DIM: usize = 64;
const BLOCK: u32 = 16;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    init_device_contexts(0, 1)?;
    let module = kernels::load_async(0)?;
```

`init_device_contexts(0, 1)` sets device 0 as the default and initializes
the device context map (capacity 1). The round-robin stream pool is created
lazily on first use. The embedded module compiled from our `#[kernel]`
functions is loaded once and shared by the typed module handle.

### Step 2: Upload shared weights

```rust
    let w0_host: Vec<f32> = (0..DIM * DIM)
        .map(|i| ((i % 7) as f32 - 3.0) * 0.01)
        .collect();
    let w1_host: Vec<f32> = (0..DIM)
        .map(|i| ((i % 5) as f32 - 2.0) * 0.01)
        .collect();

    let (w0, w1): (Arc<DeviceBox<[f32]>>, Arc<DeviceBox<[f32]>>) =
        zip!(h2d(w0_host).arc(), h2d(w1_host).arc()).await?;
```

Two independent uploads, bundled with `zip!` so they can share a stream.
`.arc()` wraps each result in `Arc` — a reference-counted pointer that costs
roughly one nanosecond to clone. Four batches, four clones, zero device
copies.

### Step 3: Build the per-batch pipeline

This is where the magic lives. For each batch, we build a four-stage chain:

```rust
    use cuda_async::simt::launch::{AsyncKernelLaunchBuilder, OwnedAsyncKernelLaunch};

    let pipeline = zip!(h2d(batch_data), zeros(DIM * DIM), zeros(DIM))
        .and_then(move |(input, hidden, output)| {
            // Stage 1: GEMM — hidden = input @ W0
            let func = module.load_function("sgemm_naive").unwrap();
            let mut builder = AsyncKernelLaunchBuilder::new(Arc::new(func));
            builder.push_args((
                DIM as u32, DIM as u32, DIM as u32,
                1.0f32,
                input.cu_deviceptr(), input.len() as u64,
                w0.cu_deviceptr(), w0.len() as u64,
                0.0f32,
                hidden.cu_deviceptr(), hidden.len() as u64,
                DIM as u32,  // hidden's row width: the third packet word a
                             // DisjointSlice<_, Runtime2DIndex> takes
            ));
            // SAFETY: packet/config match sgemm_naive (including the width
            // word for `c`), the scheduler uses the module's context, and the
            // owned wrapper retains its allocations.
            let launch = unsafe { builder.finalize_unchecked(gemm_cfg) };
            let launch = OwnedAsyncKernelLaunch::new(launch, (input, w0, hidden));
            launch.and_then(move |(_input, _w0, hidden)| {
                value((hidden, output, w1, module))
            })
        })
        .and_then(move |(hidden, output, w1, module)| {
            // Stage 2: MatVec — output = hidden @ W1
            let func = module.load_function("matvec_naive").unwrap();
            let mut builder = AsyncKernelLaunchBuilder::new(Arc::new(func));
            builder.push_args((
                DIM as u32, DIM as u32,
                hidden.cu_deviceptr(), hidden.len() as u64,
                w1.cu_deviceptr(), w1.len() as u64,
                output.cu_deviceptr(), output.len() as u64,
            ));
            // SAFETY: packet/config match matvec_naive, the scheduler uses the
            // module's context, and the owned wrapper retains its allocations.
            let launch = unsafe { builder.finalize_unchecked(matvec_cfg) };
            let launch = OwnedAsyncKernelLaunch::new(launch, (hidden, w1, output));
            launch.and_then(move |(_hidden, _w1, output)| value((output, module)))
        })
        .and_then(move |(output, module)| {
            // Stage 3: ReLU — result = max(0, output)
            let func = module.load_function("relu").unwrap();
            let relu_out: DeviceBox<[f32]> = output;
            let mut builder = AsyncKernelLaunchBuilder::new(Arc::new(func));
            builder.push_args((
                relu_out.cu_deviceptr(), relu_out.len() as u64,
                relu_out.cu_deviceptr(), relu_out.len() as u64,
            ));
            // SAFETY: packet/config match relu, the scheduler uses the module's
            // context, and the owned wrapper retains output.
            let launch = unsafe { builder.finalize_unchecked(relu_cfg) };
            OwnedAsyncKernelLaunch::new(launch, relu_out)
        })
        .and_then(d2h);
```

A few things are worth slowing down for:

**The `value()` baton.** Each `and_then` closure consumes the previous
stage's output and returns a `DeviceOperation`. Kernel launches return `()`,
so you need `value()` to carry forward the device handles the next stage
needs. Think of it as a relay baton — the kernel runs, the baton passes.

**Type annotations.** The deeply nested generics from `zip!` + `and_then`
chains exceed Rust's type inference. You will need explicit annotations on
closure parameters:

```rust
.and_then(move |(hidden, output, w1, module): (
    DeviceBox<[f32]>,
    DeviceBox<[f32]>,
    Arc<DeviceBox<[f32]>>,
    Arc<CudaModule>,
)| { ... })
```

This is the one ergonomic rough edge. The `Zippable` trait import is also
required for `zip!` to work.

**In-place ReLU.** Stage 3 passes `relu_out` as both `input` and `output`
to the kernel. Since each thread reads `input[idx]` and writes `output[idx]`
at the same index, this is safe — no thread reads another's write.

**Raw launch boundary.** The builder is inert. `finalize_unchecked` is where
the raw packet and geometry become runnable, so each call has a local safety
proof. `OwnedAsyncKernelLaunch` keeps its buffers alive. Prefer generated
owned-async methods with `PreparedLaunch<K>` when the kernel declares a launch
contract; for a runtime-width output like `c`, the generated method takes
`cuda_host::RowWidthOwned::new(buffer, width)` and marshals the third packet
word for you.

### Step 4: Spawn and collect

```rust
    handles.push(tokio::spawn(pipeline.into_future()));
```

`.into_future()` converts the lazy `DeviceOperation` into a `DeviceFuture`.
At this point the scheduling policy picks a stream (batch 0 → stream 0,
batch 1 → stream 1, round-robin). `tokio::spawn` hands the future to the
Tokio runtime.

On the first poll, the pipeline's `execute()` submits all GPU work to the
assigned stream and registers a `cuLaunchHostFunc` callback. The future
returns `Poll::Pending`. When the GPU finishes, the callback wakes the task.
No host thread spins.

```rust
    for (i, handle) in handles.into_iter().enumerate() {
        let result: Vec<f32> = handle.await.expect("Tokio task panicked")?;
        let all_non_negative = result.iter().all(|&v| v >= 0.0);
        println!("Batch {}: {} elements, first 8 = {:?}{}",
            i, result.len(), &result[..8.min(result.len())],
            if all_non_negative { " [ReLU OK]" } else { " [ReLU FAILED]" }
        );
    }
```

The ReLU sanity check is not deep learning validation — it just confirms
that the activation function ran. Every output should be non-negative. If
you see `[ReLU FAILED]`, something upstream is very wrong.

## Build, run, verify

```bash
cargo oxide run async_mlp
```

Expected output:

```text
=== Async MLP Pipeline ===

Allocating model weights...
  W0: 64x64 on device (Arc refcount=1)
  W1: 64 on device (Arc refcount=1)

Launched 4 batches concurrently, awaiting results...

Batch 0: 64 elements, first 8 = [0.0020799995, 0.0, ...] [ReLU OK]
Batch 1: 64 elements, first 8 = [0.0, 0.0, ...] [ReLU OK]
Batch 2: 64 elements, first 8 = [0.0, 0.00108, ...] [ReLU OK]
Batch 3: 64 elements, first 8 = [0.00244, 0.0025, ...] [ReLU OK]

SUCCESS: All batches completed.
```

The Arc refcounts start at 1 (one reference each for `w0` and `w1`). During
batch processing they temporarily rise to 5 (original + four clones) and
drop back as batches complete. If you add more batches, the refcounts scale
accordingly — no copies, no reallocation.

### Profiling with Nsight Systems

To see the stream overlap in action:

```bash
nsys profile --trace=cuda cargo oxide run async_mlp
nsys-ui report.nsys-rep
```

In the timeline view, look for four parallel rows of kernel blocks — one per
stream. If kernels are serialized on one stream, the round-robin scheduler
is not being used (likely `init_device_contexts` was not called, or only one
stream was configured).

---

## What makes this "real"

This is still a toy — 64×64 matrices, fake weights, three kernels. But the
*structure* is the same as production GPU pipelines:

| Production pattern                                | async_mlp equivalent                                |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Model weights loaded once, shared across requests | `zip!(h2d(w0).arc(), h2d(w1).arc())`                |
| Per-request inference pipeline                    | `and_then` chain: GEMM → MatVec → ReLU → D2H        |
| Concurrent request processing                     | `tokio::spawn(pipeline.into_future())` per batch    |
| Stream-based GPU scheduling                       | Round-robin `init_device_contexts(0, 1)`            |
| Non-blocking host                                 | `.await` on join handles, not `.sync()`             |

Scale the matrices from 64 to 4096, replace the naive kernels with tiled
shared-memory versions (see [Shared Memory](../advanced/shared-memory-and-synchronization.md)),
add more layers, and you have the skeleton of a real inference server.

---

## Extending the example

A few ideas for taking this further:

**Add a softmax layer.** Write a `#[kernel]` that computes the
[numerically stable softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function)
across the 64-element output vector. Chain it with another `.and_then` after
ReLU.

**Profile at larger dimensions.** Change `DIM` to 512 or 1024. Watch the
GEMM dominate the timeline. Then replace `sgemm_naive` with a tiled version
using `SharedArray` and observe the speedup.

**Add error recovery.** Replace `.unwrap()` in the kernel launch closures
with proper `Result` propagation. Use the three-arm `match` pattern from
the {ref}`Concurrent Execution <concurrent-error-handling>`
chapter to handle GPU errors and task panics independently.

**Multi-device.** Pass `init_device_contexts(0, 2)` to manage two GPUs.
Build a batch splitter that routes even batches to GPU 0 and odd batches to
GPU 1.

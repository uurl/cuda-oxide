# Every first-party workspace root, not just the root one.  `cargo metadata`
# stops at a `[workspace]` boundary, so one pass per root is the only way to
# reach them all.  The list is no longer a claim: the self-check below compares
# it against every tracked `[workspace]` manifest outside `examples/`, which the
# second half covers.  Today that is three, and how each got here matters:
#
#   1. Cargo.toml -- the root workspace.
#   2. crates/rustc-codegen-cuda/Cargo.toml -- its own `[workspace]` for the
#      rustc-private dylibs, so `-p` from the root cannot reach it and the root
#      `cargo metadata` stops at that boundary.  That is how the backend crate
#      itself, the largest first-party crate in the tree, sat unrecorded while
#      every other member had a row.  This is the second pass asked for in the
#      #662 review.
#   3. crates/cuda-macros/tests/device-only/Cargo.toml -- the fixture for
#      scripts/check-device-only-build.sh.  It declares `[workspace]` on
#      purpose: the point is a graph that does *not* contain `cuda-host`
#      (#701/#702), so it must resolve independently rather than share the root
#      lock.  That same boundary put it outside both passes above, and its
#      member `device-only-kernels` had no row.  #1043 closed the identical gap
#      for `cargo deny check` -- which judges the license *policy* -- and this
#      guard covers the other half, that the human-readable inventory does not
#      fall behind what a workspace declares.  Both halves need all three roots.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Second half: the example workspaces.
#
# Every example under crates/rustc-codegen-cuda/examples/ sets its own
# [workspace], so neither `cargo deny check` nor the check above resolves any
# of them -- both stop at the root workspace boundary.  Most examples declare
# only path dependencies on first-party crates and so bring nothing new, but a
# few link third-party code (tokio, rayon, libm, the shared cutile-rs crates),
# and that code is compiled by `cargo oxide run <example>` and by
# scripts/smoketest.sh without any license gate seeing it.
#
# Presence only, as above.  Lock files are parsed directly rather than through
# `cargo metadata`: resolving every example workspace separately would be slow
# and would need the network, and the lock files already record the resolved
# graph.  The search is recursive so a lockfile in a nested sub-workspace
# (e.g. cutile_inter_kernel/simt) is inventoried under its top-level example
# instead of escaping the guard.
#
# A package counts as covered when it is in the root graph, has a CSV row, or
# carries no `source` field.  That last case is a path dependency, which is
# first-party by construction.  Name matching is deliberately avoided -- some
# first-party crates are pulled from crates.io rather than by path (cuda-core
# and friends from cutile-rs), so a heuristic over names would misfile them.
# Examples whose third-party dependencies are deliberately out of inventory
# scope.  cutile_inter_kernel pulls the cutile compiler stack from cutile-rs,
# which resolves a further ~60 crates (wasm-bindgen, wit-bindgen, wasmparser,
# windows-targets) that exist in this tree only to build one interop example.
# Those crates still get a `cargo deny check` from
# check-example-license-policy.sh (the example is no longer exempt there);
# only the CSV rows are withheld.  Delete the entry to require the rows.
#
# Every name here is checked against the examples on disk below, so a typo or a
# rename fails the run instead of quietly exempting nothing -- or everything.

# Enforce deny.toml over the example workspaces, which `cargo deny check` does
# not reach.
#
# `cargo deny check` resolves the root workspace.  Every example under
# crates/rustc-codegen-cuda/examples/ sets its own `[workspace]`, so the root
# run stops at that boundary and the license, source and ban policies never see
# any crate an example pulls on its own.  #664 closed the *inventory* half of
# this (dependency-licenses.csv now records those crates); this closes the
# *policy* half, so the allow-list in deny.toml actually governs them.
#
# Measured when this guard was written: 186 of the 187 example lock files
# already satisfy the policy unchanged, so this is a guard against future drift
# rather than a fix for a present violation.  The one exception is exempted
# below, with its reason.
#
# Why one run per distinct dependency set, not one per workspace:
#
#   Every example depends on cuda-device/cuda-host by path and on the shared
#   cuda-core by the same cutile-rs pin as the root workspace, so each lock
#   file re-lists the root workspace's own transitive crates.  Grouping the
#   lock files by their exact set of third-party (name, version, source) triples
#   collapses every example lock file (one per example directory, plus one per
#   nested sub-workspace) to far fewer distinct sets, and one cargo-deny run
#   each.  The run prints both counts, so this comment does not repeat them.
#   The grouping is an equivalence, not a sample: license, source and advisory
#   verdicts are per-crate properties, so two workspaces resolving the
#   identical crate set get the identical verdict.  `bans.multiple-versions`
#   is a graph property, but deny.toml sets it to "warn", so it cannot change
#   the exit status.

# NVlabs/cutile-rs by git while `[sources] allow-git` listed only pliron, and
# cutile-rs's cuda-bindings 0.1.0 carried no license.  Both are gone: every
# example now takes the shared host crates from the same crates.io release as
# the root workspace, and the 0.3.x crates are Apache-2.0, so the example is
# judged like every other one.
#
# Every name here is checked against the examples on disk below, so a typo or a
# rename fails the run instead of quietly exempting nothing -- or everything.
# An exemption covers every lock file under the example, nested sub-workspaces
# included.

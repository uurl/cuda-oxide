# Verify the in-tree oxide-artifacts crate and the crates.io release everyone
# consumes are the same version.
#
# crates/oxide-artifacts is the source the release is published from, but no
# workspace consumes it by path any more: the backend writes artifact bundles
# and the shared cuda-core (cutile-rs) reads them, both through crates.io
# oxide-artifacts, so writer and reader are one crate. The in-tree copy can
# still drift ahead of the release; if it does, an edit to the format lands in
# git without reaching any consumer, and the next publish silently changes
# what every reader accepts. This guard fails as soon as the in-tree version,
# the workspace dependency requirements, and the versions resolved in every
# lock file disagree.
#
# Format changes therefore go: bump crates/oxide-artifacts, publish, then move
# the requirement in the root and backend manifests and relock.

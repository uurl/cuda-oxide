# Verify every copy of the shared host-crate pin agrees with the root workspace.
#
# cuda-bindings, cuda-core, and cuda-async come from cutile-rs. The root
# `[workspace.dependencies]` names the release once, but that line is copied:
#
#   1. Into every example workspace's Cargo.toml (each example is its own
#      [workspace], so it cannot inherit the root entry). A drifted copy
#      resolves a second version of the runtime and breaks the shared
#      example build cache; sync-example-locks.sh catches the lock, this
#      catches the manifest that produced it.
#
#   2. Into the `cargo oxide new` templates (SHARED_HOST_CRATES_VERSION in
#      crates/cargo-oxide/src/commands/scaffold.rs). That copy never breaks
#      this repository's CI: a stale one hands each new project a runtime
#      the generated `#[cuda_module]` code was not written against, and the
#      failure surfaces on the user's machine.
#
# The pin may be a crates.io version (`"0.3.1"`, `{ version = "0.3.1", ... }`)
# or, between a cutile-rs tag and its crates.io release, a git tag
# (`{ git = ".../cutile-rs", tag = "v0.3.1" }`). Both spell the same version,
# so the comparison is on the version string, and every manifest must also
# use the same *form* as the root (all git, or all registry).
